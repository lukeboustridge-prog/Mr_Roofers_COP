## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.4:
- Per-page HTG extraction: Granular linking (350 records vs 5 bulk)
- RANZ steps as primary: RANZ has real installation procedures, MRM has section refs
- COP excerpt fallback for MRM-only details: Better than showing "5.1" as a step

### Pending Todos

- Upload remaining 667 COP section images to R2 (not blocking v1.4)

### Blockers/Concerns

None
