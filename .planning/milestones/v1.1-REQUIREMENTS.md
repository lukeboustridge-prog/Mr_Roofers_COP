# Requirements: Master Roofers COP v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** Three-click access to authoritative roofing details with clear source attribution for Building Code citation

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for Unified COP Architecture milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Data Model (DATA) — COMPLETE

- [x] **DATA-01**: System stores cross-source links between MRM details and RANZ guides with explicit authority hierarchy
- [x] **DATA-02**: System groups categories into semantic topics enabling unified navigation across sources
- [x] **DATA-03**: System normalizes legislative references for proper NZBC citation format (E2/AS1 Amendment X Table Y)
- [x] **DATA-04**: System preserves all substrate sections (profiled-metal, pressed-metal, concrete-tile, clay-tile, membrane, shingle) even if empty

### Visual Authority (AUTH) — COMPLETE

- [x] **AUTH-01**: User can distinguish authoritative content (MRM COP) from supplementary content (RANZ Guide) through distinct visual treatment
- [x] **AUTH-02**: User sees content capability badges (3D model, steps, warnings, case law) on detail cards in listings
- [x] **AUTH-03**: User sees version watermark (MRM COP v25.12) on authoritative content
- [x] **AUTH-04**: Every content block displays its source attribution

### Navigation (NAV) — COMPLETE

- [x] **NAV-01**: User can browse details by semantic topic showing content from all sources
- [x] **NAV-02**: User can filter details by source (All / MRM COP / RANZ Guide)
- [x] **NAV-03**: User can filter details by capability (Has 3D, Has Steps, Has Warnings, Has Case Law)
- [x] **NAV-04**: User can navigate by COP section structure (Chapter/Section numbers) for consent references
- [x] **NAV-05**: User sees substrate sections with "Coming Soon" placeholder when no content exists

### Detail Page (DETAIL) — COMPLETE

- [x] **DETAIL-01**: User sees RANZ 3D model and installation steps when linked to MRM detail
- [x] **DETAIL-02**: User can view MRM technical images in gallery format (not just thumbnails)
- [x] **DETAIL-03**: User can access related content from other source via Related tab
- [x] **DETAIL-04**: Detail page dynamically shows only available content sections

### Search (SEARCH) — COMPLETE

- [x] **SEARCH-01**: Search results weight MRM content higher than RANZ content (2x boost)
- [x] **SEARCH-02**: Search results group by source showing MRM first, then RANZ
- [x] **SEARCH-03**: User can enable "Consent Mode" to show only authoritative content
- [x] **SEARCH-04**: User can search by COP section number (type "4.3.2" to jump to section)

### Content Linking (LINK) — COMPLETE

- [x] **LINK-01**: System automatically suggests links between MRM and RANZ details by code matching
- [x] **LINK-02**: Admin can create, edit, and delete cross-source links via admin UI
- [x] **LINK-03**: System validates that all content scenarios work (MRM-only, RANZ-only, both linked, neither)

## v1.2+ Requirements (Future)

Deferred to later milestones. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### BCA Integration

- **BCA-01**: System engages major BCAs (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch) for acceptance validation
- **BCA-02**: System provides consent evidence export format
- **BCA-03**: System tracks BCA feedback on digital COP acceptance

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: System detects conflicts between RANZ guidance and MRM specifications
- **ADV-02**: System provides immutable version snapshots with audit trail
- **ADV-03**: System supports multiple concurrent COP versions for transitional compliance

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User-editable normative content | Would compromise citation integrity |
| AI-generated COP summaries | Cannot be cited as authoritative |
| Blending sources without attribution | Would cause authority dilution |
| Real-time BCA API integration | No BCA APIs exist; requires manual process |
| Membrane COP content import | Source content not yet available |

## Traceability
