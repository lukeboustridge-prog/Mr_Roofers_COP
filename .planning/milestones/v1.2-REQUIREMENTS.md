## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for v1.2 Digital COP milestone. Restructure navigation to mirror the MRM COP PDF structure.

### COP Reader Foundation

- [x] **COPR-01**: User can browse all 19 MRM COP chapters via a table of contents matching the PDF structure
- [x] **COPR-02**: Every section, subsection, and sub-subsection displays its original MRM COP number exactly as in the PDF (e.g. "8.5.4 Change of Pitch")
- [x] **COPR-03**: User can navigate directly to any COP section via a URL containing the section number (e.g. `/cop/8.5.4`)
- [x] **COPR-04**: Technical diagrams from the MRM COP appear inline within their parent section's content (775 images, 772 section-mapped)
- [x] **COPR-05**: Each chapter renders as scrollable rich text with proper heading hierarchy, paragraphs, tables, and figures
- [x] **COPR-06**: COP version identifier ("v25.12 -- 1 December 2025") is displayed prominently in the COP Reader

### Navigation

- [x] **NAV-01**: Breadcrumb trail shows full hierarchy (COP > Chapter 8 > 8.5 Flashing Types > 8.5.4 Change of Pitch) with each level tappable
- [x] **NAV-02**: Desktop shows a collapsible TOC sidebar with chapter/section tree; mobile shows a slide-out drawer
- [x] **NAV-03**: As user scrolls through chapter content, the TOC sidebar highlights the currently visible section (scrollspy)

### Supplementary Content

- [x] **SUPP-01**: When a COP section has linked supplementary content (3D model, HTG guide, or failure case), a collapsible inline panel appears within the section -- collapsed by default
- [x] **SUPP-02**: Supplementary panels are visually distinct from authoritative MRM content (grey border, "Supplementary" label)

### HTG Content Pipeline

- [x] **HTG-01**: Content extracted from the 3 RANZ HTG PDFs (Flashings, Penetrations, Cladding) into structured data
- [x] **HTG-02**: Extracted HTG content mapped to corresponding MRM COP sections
- [x] **HTG-03**: HTG content appears as collapsible inline panels within the relevant COP sections (using SUPP-01 infrastructure)

### Existing Modes

- [x] **MODE-01**: Fixer mode (task-first on-site navigation) continues to function unchanged
- [x] **MODE-02**: COP Reader becomes the primary "Planner" navigation path (chapter-first replaces substrate-first)
