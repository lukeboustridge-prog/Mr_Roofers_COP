Where a 2% probability of flooding is unacceptable, a\nhigher figure should be used.\nInternal Gutters Commercial have a minimum factor of 2.2 as failure of these gutters is less likely to cause\nsevere damage and water run time may be longer. Short runs and steep pitches will reduce run time. (At\n250 mm/hr intensity and 3 degrees pitch, rain will take 2 minutes to travel 15 metres). For short runs, steeper\npitches and where the probability of flooding of 2% is unacceptable, a higher figure should be used.\nExternal Gutters no overflow have a minimum factor of 2.5, providing the building has a soffit. Otherwise, they\nshould be treated as an internal gutter.\nExternal Gutters with overflow have a minimum factor of 1, provided the building has a soffit, as occasional\noverflow is not likely to cause damage. To qualify as drained, the back of the gutter must be below the fascia\nheight and it must have a gap of at least 3 mm between the gutter and the fascia or cladding. This gap must be\nmaintained in all areas, including internal angles. External gutters to buildings without soffit must be provided\nwith a 10 mm drainage gap or be designed as an internal gutter.\nFor convenience, ARI maps are included in the calculation section which includes tables for gutter and valley\ncapacity for different rainfall intensities.\nMinimum Freeboard Values \nIn gutters where overflow can enter the structure, freeboard is necessary to allow for wave action, obstructions,\nand other unforeseen circumstances. Capacity Calculations allow for these minimum freeboard values.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5.3 ROOF DRAINAGE DESIGN",

A designed\noutlet is preferred, either a gutter bracket creating a minimum 6 mm space stop end, a weir, a raised outlet above\nthe spouting sole, a slotted front, or a low fronted gutter.\nA weir stop-end, or an outlet with a top edge above the sole of the gutter, can be used to increase outlet capacity.\nGutter Fall \nAll gutters should have a minimum fall of 1:500 (2 mm in 1 m). A 1:200 (5 mm in 1 m) fall will give faster water\nflow and better self-cleaning, but it may look unattractive on external spouting due to misalignment with the\nfascia, and exposure of roof sheet ends, on longer lengths\n5.4.2.1A Effect of Gutter Fall on Drainage Capacity\n0 1 in \n1 in \n1 in \n1 in \n1 in \n1in \nGutter Fall Ratio\nComparative roof area \n(m ) drained\nMaximum Gutter Length \nAll gutters are subject to expansion. Maximum gutter-length is determined by the type of metal and its colour.\nWhere gutters have an allowance for expansion (such as an external gutter on a typical gutter bracket or an\ninternal gutter with sliding clips), lengths should be restricted to 25 m in steel and 12 m for copper or aluminium.\nAn expansion joint can be either a sump, rainwater head or a saddle flashing. Gutters that are directly through-\nfastened to the fascia or eaves purlin will not be free to move and should be restricted to a maximum of 12 m.\nThrough-fastened gutters are not recommended as they are difficult to replace.\nSpouting Support Systems \nThe spouting bracket system must withstand the potential weight of a gutter full of water.

When using the COP calculator, discharge\nmay be into a lapped trough of a trapezoidal or a trough profile.\nThe area of discharge holes from a spreader should equal the cross-sectional area of the downpipe.\nThe 5.8.1 Maximum Area Above Spreader Calculator enables users to determine the maximum upper roof\narea that a lower roof can discharge for a given combination of rainfall intensity, roofing profile, and lower roof\npitch.\n5.8A Downpipe Spreader design\nUse the online calculator\nto determine the maximum \narea above spreader, based\non discharge capacity of the\nlower roof.\nArea of the discharge holes\n= cross sectional area \nof the downpipe.\nLower roof drainage capacity determines maximum\narea above \nspreader. It is dependent on:\n rainfall intensity,\n lower roof profile,\n lower roof pitch,\n lower roof length, \ndownpipe/spreader capacity\nDischarge holes every \nsecond corrugation.\nMaximum Area Above Spreader Calculator \nBefore using this calculator, please read 5.3 Roof Drainage Design.\nCalculate the maximum area above a spreader by entering the values in the designated fields.\nFor an explanation of each element, please click on the corresponding question mark.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5.8 DOWNPIPE SPREADERS\nFor rainfall intensities, refer to NIWA's HIRDS tool or the 5.3.2 Rainfall Intensity.\nA responsive online tool for calculating Maximum Area Above Spreaders is available at\nhttps://www.metalroofing.org.nz/maximum-area-above-spreader-calculator.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5.8 DOWNPIPE SPREADERS",

(See 8.5.4C Angle Diverter);\nthe side apron flashing can be folded to 110 deg ( see 8.5.4D Angled Apron - 110 deg );\nan apron internal angle flashing can be folded to two angles at 135 deg (See 8.5.4E Angled Apron - 45 deg ); or\nusing a two-piece apron (See 8.5.4F Two-piece Apron).\nSpouting should be fitted after the wall has been finished and should be clear of the wall cladding.\nAprons should be stop-ended and turned down to weather and bird-proof the end of the apron at this junction.\nWhen flashing a cavity parapet, the apron should be in place before the cavity batten as it is not possible to\nretrofit the apron. The apron material should have a 50-year durability unless the parapet cladding is easy to\nreplace.\nWhen a chase or rebate (8.5.4G Chase-fixed Flashing) is not provided, a pressure bar flashing can be used\nto weather an apron flashing into a concrete tilt-up slab wall. \n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8.5 FLASHING TYPES",

Ideally this should be in position before the roof cladding is fixed; alternatively, the supporting\nframework should be in position before cutting a hole in the cladding.\nThe additional support for larger penetrations must have the same strength as the adjacent purlins. Purlins and\nthe support structure must be designed to take the additional weight of any plant exceeding 100 kg. Structural\nmembers must not be removed without engineering calculations.\nPenetrations Safety \nThe person who cuts a hole greater than 600 mm x 600 mm in the roof is responsible for safety precautions,\npreventing workers from falling through the gap.

    "description": "Boot Flashings \nA boot flashing is a proprietary EPDM flashing designed to weatherproof cylindrical penetrations protruding from\na roof or wall. The top is trimmed to form a tight weatherproof collar around the penetration, and the base is\nformed with a series of concentric rings to the underside and a malleable stiffener of aluminium which is dressed\nto conform to the shape of the roofing profile. It is generally top-fixed to the roof surface with screws or rivets,\nand sealant.\nThe Profiled Metal Roofing COP allows pipe penetration flashings to be fitted directly to the profile or on to an\nover flashing. Pitch limitations depend on the method used and the cladding profile.\nDirect-fixed options are pitch sensitive. When laid directly on to the profile at too low a pitch, they will entrap\nwater rather than allow it to discharge over the profile crests that they traverse. The practical limits of direct-fixed\nboot flashings that cross an entire pan are 8 deg for standard corrugated and 10 deg for low rib trapezoidal products.\nWhere the base of a boot does not obstruct a pan it can be direct-fixed to the minimum pitch for that profile.\nDirect fixed applications for high rib trapezoidal profiles and trough sections vary according to the profile, and the\nsize and position of the penetration. For these applications, the manufacturer should be consulted or the flashing\ncan be attached to an over flashing, or a top fixed soaker type can be used.\nWhere the penetration is wide such as a chimney flue casing, and the penetration is far from the apex, soaker\nflashings may be used where the profile ribs are cut back so water can divert into the adjacent pan.\nWhere overall width is not a constraint, directly fixed boot flashings should be installed with their edges diagonal\nto the fall of water. Where this is not practical, they may be laid square at pitches of 10 deg or more.\nWhere boot flashings traverse a lap, the lap must be fully sealed or other actions must be taken to avoid leaks\nthrough capillary action. Where possible the fixing of a boot flashing over a lap should be avoided\nThe vertical sections of a boot flashing must not constrict the free flow of water. Where more than 50% blockage\nof the pan occurs other penetrations must be considered, or catchment calculations of the capacity of the\nremaining pan area should be made.

Acceptable Solution E3/AS1 1.0.1 says fungal growth can be\navoided by minimising internal condensation. While it gives no prescriptive solutions for achieving this, it has\nbeen shown that venting ceiling spaces has a significant effect not only in minimising the growth of mould in\nceiling spaces and ceilings, but also improves the air quality within the occupied spaces of a dwelling.\nIncreased levels of ceiling insulation results in less heat escape into the ceiling cavity. This lowers the\ntemperature of the ceiling cavity, which lowers the dew point, increasing the frequency and severity of\ncondensation. This can not only cause problems with mould growth and occupant health, but excess moisture\ncan also affect the durability of the roof and the structure.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.1 NZBC CLAUSE E3: INTERNAL MOISTURE (EXTRACT)",

Mould was worst in rental accommodation, where much of our most vulnerable population live.\nIn addition to the health effects, excessive internal moisture impacts material durability. In the roof space, this\ncan affect the roof cladding, underlay, purlins, trusses, fasteners, and seriously affect the durability and structural\nintegrity of those components without being apparent to the occupants.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE",

Problems arise in ceiling spaces when more water vapour enters than exits, and materials\nstay wet for long periods, or where standing water accumulates.\nThe primary purpose of roof cladding is to act as a rain screen so that no water enters the building from the\noutside. It is, however, equally important to ensure that the building is kept dry from inside. Because metal is a\ngood heat conductor and is not absorbent, condensation forms on metal cladding under conditions of high\nhumidity when surface temperatures drop below the dew point.\nThe solutions in the Code of Practice apply to cold roofs, where there is a gap between the ceiling insulation and\nthe roofing material. 10.12.2 Warm Roofs require specific design to avoid internal moisture problems.

Ceiling insulation excludes more heat from the ceiling cavity, resulting in\ncolder cavity air temperatures. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than cold air. Therefore, colder\ntemperatures in the ceiling cavity lead to an increased risk of condensation.\nInsulation Position \nInsulation must be positioned so that there is a gap of at least 20 mm between insulation and roofing. On flat\nceilings, or buildings without eaves, it must be placed so the gap is maintained at the eaves or an eaves\ninsulation barrier should be fitted. To achieve this, an eaves insulation barrier may be required.\nOther Insulation \nReflective foils are not defined as insulating, because they are only somewhat effective against radiative heat\nloss and have little impact on conductive and convective mechanisms. They also increase the potential for\nelectrocution. As they are non-absorbent, they are not permitted as residential roofing underlay in New Zealand.\nWhen Polyester blanket insulation is used in conjunction with metal roof cladding, special roofing screws should\nbe used to avoid binding.\nComposite insulated metal panels are described in 15.5 Warm Roofs.\nInsulation must not be laid over the purlins as this compromises the air gap and the efficiency of the insulation\nwhere the roofing compresses it.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.6 INSULATION",

    "description": "Insulation \nThe increase in ceiling insulation standards helps prevent heat leakage into the ceiling space, but it does not\naffect the passage of water vapour. Ceiling insulation excludes more heat from the ceiling cavity, resulting in\ncolder cavity air temperatures. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than cold air. Therefore, colder\ntemperatures in the ceiling cavity lead to an increased risk of condensation.\nInsulation Position \nInsulation must be positioned so that there is a gap of at least 20 mm between insulation and roofing. On flat\nceilings, or buildings without eaves, it must be placed so the gap is maintained at the eaves or an eaves\ninsulation barrier should be fitted. To achieve this, an eaves insulation barrier may be required.\nOther Insulation \nReflective foils are not defined as insulating, because they are only somewhat effective against radiative heat\nloss and have little impact on conductive and convective mechanisms. They also increase the potential for\nelectrocution. As they are non-absorbent, they are not permitted as residential roofing underlay in New Zealand.\nWhen Polyester blanket insulation is used in conjunction with metal roof cladding, special roofing screws should\nbe used to avoid binding.\nComposite insulated metal panels are described in 15.5 Warm Roofs.\nInsulation must not be laid over the purlins as this compromises the air gap and the efficiency of the insulation\nwhere the roofing compresses it.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.6 INSULATION",

Compared to much of the world - where 70% relative humidity is considered the\nthreshold of corrosion and health problems - New Zealand has very high humidity, particularly in northern\nregions, where the mean annual humidity levels are often around 80% or more. This means the dew point\n(temperature at which condensation begins to form) is also higher than in colder but drier climates.\nThe design requirements to deal with this environment are specific to New Zealand, which is reflected in our\nbuilding practices. It is not advisable to use design or installation practices from countries with different\nenvironmental conditions without a comprehensive assessment of the management of internal moisture under\nNZ conditions.\nHumidity \nRelative humidity (RH, given in per cent [%]), is the most widely known method: It gives the content of water\nvapour in the air relative to the maximum amount of water this parcel of air can hold at its present temperature.\nOther measures are absolute humidity and water vapour pressure.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.7 CLIMATE",

    "description": "Minimising Ingress of Water Vapour into the Ceiling Cavity \nThe first line of defence for managing roof space moisture levels is maintaining low relative humidity in the\ndwelling areas. The second line is preventing excessive amounts of moisture entering the ceiling cavity. It is\nrecommended that all ceilings are square stopped and all penetrations (cables, pipes, hatches, etc.) are caulked.\nOnly use downlights that are airtight and have a gasket\nA gloss painted plasterboard ceiling presents some resistance to the passage of water vapour but is not a\ncomplete barrier. Vapour will also find its way through any minor gaps in architectural details, and it is air\ntransport through gaps that is responsible for 95% of the passage of water vapour into the ceiling space.\nCeiling tiles and tongue and groove ceilings are considerably more porous than plasterboard. Unsealed\ndownlights can be a major source of moisture movement into the ceiling cavity and should be avoided where\npossible.\nSee BRANZ Facts Roof Ventilation #3 .\nIn some older New Zealand homes, vapour barriers have been used to limit entry of moist air into the ceiling\nspace, but control of air movement into the cavity and removal of damp air by ventilation is a more practical\napproach.\nCavity systems prescribed under E2AS1 9.1.8.1, except those behind masonry veneer, are classified as drained\nnot ventilated. That means they must be closed at the top to restrict air movement between the cavity and the\nroof space. Closing a cavity off at the top still allows reasonable ventilation of the cavity while preventing\nexcessive amounts of moisture rising to the ceiling space. Alternatively, wall cavities can be vented externally.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\nCAVITY",

This is not always\nnecessary, or even desirable...\"\nSimple techniques to provide a clear path for air to enter, travel along and exit the roof cavity can include:\nEaves:\nAllow air entry by soffit vents, over-fascia or behind-fascia vents, or by using fleece-lined roofing material.\nEnsuring that insulation does not impinge on the underside of the roof at the eaves. This can be achieved by\nusing a heeled truss, eaves baffle, or both.\nBody:\nEnsuring that the air can travel under the roof. If insulation is flush with the underside of the purlins it can\nbe done using a vented batten between the purlin and the underlay, or by using fleece lined roofing material.\nApex:\nMaking the roof underlay discontinuous at the apex by cutting or slitting the underlay and using a vented\nsoft edge or vented ridge.\nSarked roofs must have a gap in the sarking at eaves and apex, or by an alternative eaves-to-apex passage.\nWith skillion roof or flat roof construction, the air volume is significantly reduced, so moisture saturation levels\nare more quickly reached. Also with these roof types, air flow paths are more easily obstructed. In skillion roofs\nwith tongue and groove ceilings, a layer of roof underlay immediately above the ceiling will provide a vapour\ncheck and air barrier to compensate for the porosity of the ceiling. For more advice on skillion roof ventilation,\nsee https://www.branz.co.nz/pubs/branz-facts/roof-ventilation/4-skillion-roofs/\nRoofs continuous over an apex, such as barrel curved roofs or roofs with prickled ridges, must have adequate\nventilation to prevent the accumulation of moisture at the apex.\nLong low-pitched roofs will benefit from increased ventilation which may also assist in minimising thermally\ninduced expansion noise. Ventilation typically increases as the roof pitch increases. Air movement through the\ncrests depends on the spacing and area of the crests, roof pitch, and overall length of the sheeting. Corrugate and\ntrapezoidal roofing provide more ventilation than secret-fix roofing. Ventilation through the crests still depends\non air being allowed to enter at the eaves and escape at the apex.\nTrough or tray section roofs have smaller ventilation channels and may require additional ventilation.\nThe use of profiled closures at eaves or ridge will create a substantial air barrier, and alternative ventilation paths\nmust be created.\nAdditional roof space ventilation may take the form of:\nlouvre vents in gable-ends,\nsoffit vents,\nproprietary ridge vents,\nventilated soft edge strips on transverse flashings, or\nmechanical or wind-powered vents positioned close to the apex.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS",

This creates a low-pressure area, so they draw air\nfrom the ventilated area at a greater rate than stationary vents. The amount of air movement can be dampened\nbut is normally uncontrolled; it is developed as a function of wind speed as well as turbine size and efficiency.\nTurbine vents, unlike commercial ridge vents, are unaffected by wind direction and they are less prone to leaking.\nBattens \nBattens may be required to create a separation space between the roofing and the underlay. In some applications,\nthey may need to be ventilated to achieve sufficient airflow.\nThe type and number of fixings required to fix the counter battens to the roof structure must meet the design wind\nload, or the roof fasteners should be long enough to achieve the required penetration into the purlin below.\nBattens or counter battens, if not fixed by extended cladding fasteners, can be fixed using countersunk purlin\nscrews or if fixed with hex headed screws, they should be counter-bored before installation to avoid damage to\nthe roof cladding.\nSteel top hat, C or Z sections are also used as counter battens but require an additional insulating spacer to\navoid thermal bridging.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS",

    "description": "Underlay \nCondensation that forms on the cold under-surface of the roof system must be contained until ambient\nconditions allow it to evaporate. Containment is normally achieved by using an absorbent roofing underlay. It is\nthe role of roofing underlay to absorb moisture temporarily and then release it back into the atmosphere.\nA printable bulletin about installing underlay when reroofing is\navailable at: BU01 Double laying of Underlay on Re-roof\nExtract:\n\"...we recommend that no more than a single layer of compliant underlay (laps\nexcluded) is present on a profiled metal roof.\"\nA common misconception holds that the roofing underlay acts as a drainage plane, channelling condensation\nfrom the underside of the metal roof to the gutter. In practice, most of the condensation forms on the underside\nof the underlay. Although roofing underlays are permeable, they still form a substantial vapour check, and as they\nare in contact with the roof, they are at a similar temperature. Any condensation that does form on the underside\nof the roof and falls onto the underlay generally only tracks down the underlay as far as the next purlin, where it is\ntrapped and absorbed by the underlay. Underlay is also affected by holes from roofing fasteners, making it\nunreliable as a \"second roof\".\nAs it is designed to execute its primary purpose of aiding in the management of internal moisture, underlay\nshould not be used as a compensation for unreliable weatherproofing design and installation\nSmall Space:Condensation on \nunderside of cladding;often not muc\nbecause of small air volume.\nCondensation on top can be large \nwhen air is moist and calm.\nPermeable underlay in contact with \ncladding gets cold. The resulting \ncondensation get absorbed by the \nunderlay, which can be significant if \nthe attic air is moist.\nPermeable underlay stays a \nbit warmer, no condensation\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.11 UNDERLAY",

    "description": "NZBC Clause B2.3.1 requires non-structural building elements and those that are moderately difficult to replace\nto have a durability of 15 years, or, if difficult to replace, to have the same durability as the more durable elements\nof a system. Alternatively, the design should allow the replacement of the less durable elements without\nremoving the more durable components.\nCompliance with NZBC B2, therefore, requires roofing underlay to have durability equal to that of the roof\ncladding and no less than 15 years.\nWhen finishing on an eaves flashing the eaves flashing should finish on the horizontal face of the eaves flashing\nso that is is not exposed to UV or able to flap in the wind.\nAll underlays, particularly those made from synthetics (including some foils), may be vulnerable to degradation\nfrom fumes and reflected UV. Advice should be requested from the supplier when they are to be used in a\nsituation where they may be exposed to fumes or reflected UV.\nInstalling Underlay \nUnderlay can be laid vertically or horizontally. Side laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for roofs and 75 mm for\nwalls; end laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for both roof and wall cladding. At the eaves, the underlay should\nterminate on the upper side of the eaves flashing or overhang fascia by no more than 20 mm.\nThe COP recommends that all underlay is terminated at the ridge, and if not it should be slit or slotted to allow\npassive ventilation of the ceiling cavity.\nThe COP allows roof and wall underlay to be laid either vertically or horizontally in all cases. However, that is in\ndivergence with E2/AS1, so it is advised for buildings within the scope of E2/AS1 (ie, buildings designed within\nthe scope of NZS 3604) that the requirements of the local BCA (Building Consent Authority) is sought before\ndiverging from E2/AS1.\nRips smaller than 75 mm on walls or roofs can be repaired using a compatible flashing tape, but roof underlay\ndamage greater than this requires a new piece of underlay captured by the cladding fastenings.\nFlue penetrations must have a minimum distance of 50 mm from the outer liner to any underlay or flammable\nmaterial.\nE2/AS1 requires self-support underlay laid horizontally on support to be used at pitches below 10 deg . That is not a\nrequirement of the COP as underlay support is no substitute for good ventilation design and effective\nweathertight details.\nWhen using vented battens, the underlay should be positioned on the upper side of the batten, directly under the\nroof cladding. Having the underlay directly under the roof allows the battens to vent the roof cavity directly and\nallows the underlay to perform its normal design function; putting roofing underlay under ventilated battens\nimpedes roof cavity ventilation\nWith re-roofs in any material, it is not acceptable to lay a new roof over existing underlay or underlay support,\nunless the latter is in \"as new\" condition. See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium Sheeting.\nWall underlays must have a minimum side lap of 150 mm and an end lap of 75 mm. Wall underlay on a drained\ncavity should be on the dry (inside) face of the cavity, and be rigid enough to restrain wall insulation from\ncontacting the cladding, or have secondary strapping to achieve such.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10.11 UNDERLAY",

    "description": "All tray roofs can be seamed at the junction of roof and wall, without the need for prickles.\nTray Roofing Weathertightness \nThe malleable nature of the metal used to manufacture tray roofing, the wide pan, and the vertical rib, give many\noptions for achieving weathertightness. Generally, options that work with a trapezoidal profile will equally work\nfor tray roofing but are most likely to be installed on secret grab fasteners rather than being riveted. The\nelimination of primary and secondary fasteners is another attribute abetting weathertightness, as are the tight\nlaps and the water carrying capacity of the wide pan.\nThe wide pan of tray roofing makes it impractical to have longitudinal flashings cover two pans, and because of\nthe vertical rib and fastening techniques, longitudinal flashings covering a single pan are acceptable.\nTray Fixings \nPerhaps the most outstanding feature of all tray roofs is the minimisation of visible fasteners. Apart from the\nsecret fixing clips, attachment of flashings to the roof should be achieved by crimping to the cladding or other\nflashings or to a grab flashing wherever possible.\nClips for standing seam roofing are normally single clips, fastened to the substrate with screws or annular\ngrooved nails. The sole of the clips should have a rebated or countersunk hole for the fastener, and rounded\nedges, to ensure thermal movement of the sheet does not cause damage by rubbing against sharp edges.\nWall cladding laid horizontally may need additional support and the standard bracket to resist gravity loads.\nStanding Seam End Laps \nAs the style of roofing replicates hand-formed products of yesteryear, and because the sheets themselves are\nrelatively flexible, end laps are more common in tray roofs, and more acceptable, than with other profiles. In\npractice, staggered end laps are often used with tray roofing as an architectural design feature.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING",
