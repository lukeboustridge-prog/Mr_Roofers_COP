(MRM), to provide:\nacceptable trade practice for fixing metal roofing, metal wall cladding, and accessories,\nprescriptive detailing for designers, and\nsets a benchmark for the standard of detailing and workmanship required over and above that required to\ncomply with the NZBC.\nThe COP does not describe or dismiss alternative methods, which may need specific acceptance by the Building\nConsent Authorities.\nIt is published in accordance with current technology, materials, and building codes. The COP will be periodically\nupdated to reflect changes in legislation and standards or improvements in technology and available materials.\nThe most current Code of Practice is available on the MRM website, www.metalroofing.org.nz/cop, as Code\nof Practice Online (MRM COP Version 25.12).\nIn the latest update (on 1 December 2025), we made few substantial changes to recommendations. Most of the\nrevision consisted of editing and rearrangement for clarity, consistency, and accuracy. We have also linked all\npublished Bulletins to the relevant content in the CoP.\nImportant changes\n8.4.2 Clearances and Minimum Slope for Flashing Cover was substantially revised and renamed.\nWe updated our recommendations on the limitations for 9.4.1.1 Overflashed (Watershed)\nBackflashings and added clearer guidance on their construction, supported by a new illustration.\nA new illustration was added to 8.5.4.2 Change Of Pitch to clarify recommendations for minimising rust\non change-of-pitch junctions.\nEditing and rearrangement\n15.1.1A Spring Curving Calculator has been updated and can now work from either height or desired\nradius to enable profile selection and calculate the total length of seal required.\nWe made some edits for clarity and added a reference to wall cladding to 17.1.3.2 Point Load Testing.\nIn 4.6.3 Material Selection, we changed materials endorsed as complying with AS/NZS 2728 coating\ntypes to align with the current product range.\n 1 \n 1 \n8\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nBulletins\nPublished bulletins are now linked to relevant content in the Code of Practice.\nSix new bulletins are now available from Bulletins on the MRM Home page:\nBI01 The Importance of Maintenance of Metal Roofing and Walling \nBEMF01 Change of Pitch Flashings \nBU02 Over-Saturation of Underlay \nBPD01 Wide Over-Flashings Behind Penetrations \nBWLS01 End Spans of Roofing Sheets \nFor a detailed list of updates, please visit 19.1 v25.12 December 2025 in the Code of Practice.\nImportant Notice:\nIn a move to help us better understand our audience and make the NZMRM Metal and Wall Roof Cladding\nCode of Practice even more useful and relevant, we are introducing an industry selector to the existing\nregistration form. If your particular industry is not listed please select one that is closest.\nRegistration is important so everybody will be informed of important revisions which is done on a quarterly\nschedule. You will only receive four emails per year regarding our updates.\nThe data gathered stays anonymous and will never be shared with anyone outside the NZMRM.\n 1 \n 1 \n9\nThis is a controlled document.

This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n1.5 \nDisputes \nUnder the provisions of the Building Act and the NZBC, a contractor who undertakes to do work on a building\nimplies that he can produce an effective and sound result which will fulfil its intended purpose.\nThere is a customer expectation, backed by consumer legislation, that the finished work will leave the building\nweathertight, and the work done will comply with the NZBC and will be to a standard that is described as\n\"acceptable trade practice\".\n\"Acceptable trade practice\" and \"good trade practice\" for the Roofing Industry are both described and contained in\nthis Code of Practice. In addition to any contractual or verbal offer there may also be a written obligation given in\nthe form of a warranty. See 16.9 Material Selection\nAll contractors should ensure that materials they use comply with the requirements and specifications contained\nwithin this Code of Practice. All suppliers' or manufacturers' product literature should be dated; and where\nsuperseding previous literature the dates should be referenced. The user must ensure that suppliers or\nmanufacturers product literature is the latest version published.\nContractors must be satisfied that the product as described in the product literature is acceptable to the\nTerritorial Authority, and contractors must be aware of their liability under law and the contractual documents\nthey have signed or agreed to.\nCustomer expectation is supported by law that states that the material and product used must be fit for its\nintended purpose, and the liability of each of the parties is assessed on their 'failure to warn that the product\nwould not fulfil a perceived function\".\nPoor workmanship is a common cause of dispute and it is often given as the reason for non-payment between\nthe sub-contractor and contractor or owner. This Code of Practice provides a standard of workmanship and a\nbenchmark for arbitration.\nIt is in the interest of all parties to avoid the cost and delay of litigation and although there are other voluntary\nways to settle disputes, they all require some compromise by those concerned.\nOne voluntary method is negotiation by calling a site meeting where all interested parties can air their grievances\nacross a table and draw up a programme of rectification and reach an agreement over responsibilities and\npayment.\nAny agreement must be recorded, signed and state what is to be done, how much is to be paid, by whom, by when,\nand how it will be accepted and checked. If no agreement can be reached then a solution may be found through\nmediation.\nThe Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 provides for a mediation service to be available to\ndwelling/house owners with eligible claims. The claiming owner and any of the other parties against whom the\nclaim is made may agree to refer the claim to mediation, with provision for binding settlements by agreement.\nThis service is restricted to leaky homes built within 10 years of the claim.\n1.5.1 \nMediation \n 1 \n 1.5 DISPUTES\n 5 \n 1 \n 1.5 \n15\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nMediation is a cost-effective, confidential, and voluntary process where the mediator is the facilitator who assists\nthe parties in reaching a negotiated agreement. Mediation concentrates on the parties' interests rather than on\ntheir rights, when often both parties realise that they are partly at fault and wish to resolve the dispute and accept\na compromise, as opposed to litigation. Any recorded settlement in a mediation agreement can be enforced as a\ncontract, but if they cannot settle, they can resort to arbitration or the courts.\nAn impartial mediator is appointed and should act independently, avoid unnecessary expenses and comply with\nthe principles of natural justice. The mediator's task is to help the parties identify the issues and options for\nsettlement and seek a settlement that is fair to all concerned. All relevant documents including specifications,\nplans, quotations, and written submissions setting out the basis of the complaint and the rebuttal by the other\nparty must be provided to the mediator.\nAfter an investigation, site visits, and discussion with all the parties, the mediator, using trade benchmarks such\nas this Code of Practice and drawing on experience can apportion responsibilities and instruct rectification work\nbe done. This method can provide a quick and inexpensive outcome with costs shared by both parties, but the\ndecision is not binding and must be mutually agreed to.\nInformal resolution of disputes does not necessarily uncover the facts; and as material or installation failures are\nnot necessarily publicly disclosed, improvement can be inhibited.\nMediation does provide the opportunity to 'move on' and does not always jeopardize business relationships as\nlitigation invariably does.\n1.5.2 \nAdjudication \nThe Construction Contracts Act allows for a dispute process called adjudication, to be the first option if\nnegotiation fails. It involves a thirty-day formal process during which the claimant appoints an adjudicator, and\nthe respondent cannot opt out. The process is designed mainly for payment disputes, but it can also be used for\nworkmanship disputes and is expected to become the normal dispute resolution method in the Construction\nIndustry.\nThe adjudicator's decision, called a determination, is binding and enforceable by the courts. An unsatisfied party\nmay only appeal an adjudication after complying with the determination. The adjudication is subject to\nconfidentiality, except by mutual consent or if the information is already in the public domain.\nThe disadvantage of both mediation and adjudication is that the faults are not published to the roofing industry,\nwho should be able to learn from the mistakes of the past.\nWhere the amount in question is under $7,500, or $12,000 by agreement with the other party, an alternative\nmethod is to file the complaint with the Disputes Tribunal. The parties usually represent themselves, without\nlawyers, and a compromise outcome is sought by a referee. This method of settlement gives no assurance of an\nequitable outcome or that the outcome will be based on technical grounds; the main purpose of this court is to\nseek agreement between the parties.\n1.5.3 \nArbitration and Litigation \nArbitration is usually a strict and formal process similar to litigation in which the parties may be legally\nrepresented, and select and pay for the arbitrator. Arbitrators must comply with the Arbitration Act; their imposed\ndecision is known as an award, and it is final and binding.\n 1 \n 1.5 DISPUTES\n 5 \n 1 \n 1.5 \n16\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nThe final and most expensive alternative is litigation. That usually involves suing for breach of contract, non-\npayment, non-performance, faulty materials, or non-compliance. Judgment is publicly imposed and usually made\nby comparison with \"state of the art\" materials and practices available at the time the contract was signed.\nBoth arbitration and litigation can be prolonged and the parties' cost may exceed the amount in dispute.\nWhen roofing contractors sublet the contract, they assume the same responsibility as though they carried out the\nwork.\nTo avoid disputes, roofing suppliers and contractors must give adequate instruction, training, and supervision.\nThey should also keep their staff informed of industry developments and with the contents of the New Zealand\nMetal Roof and Wall Cladding Code of Practice.\n 1 \n 1.5 DISPUTES\n 5 \n 1 \n 1.5 \n17\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.",

In addition to any contractual or verbal offer there may also be a written obligation given in\nthe form of a warranty. See 16.9 Material Selection\nAll contractors should ensure that materials they use comply with the requirements and specifications contained\nwithin this Code of Practice. All suppliers' or manufacturers' product literature should be dated; and where\nsuperseding previous literature the dates should be referenced. The user must ensure that suppliers or\nmanufacturers product literature is the latest version published.\nContractors must be satisfied that the product as described in the product literature is acceptable to the\nTerritorial Authority, and contractors must be aware of their liability under law and the contractual documents\nthey have signed or agreed to.\nCustomer expectation is supported by law that states that the material and product used must be fit for its\nintended purpose, and the liability of each of the parties is assessed on their 'failure to warn that the product\nwould not fulfil a perceived function\".\nPoor workmanship is a common cause of dispute and it is often given as the reason for non-payment between\nthe sub-contractor and contractor or owner. This Code of Practice provides a standard of workmanship and a\nbenchmark for arbitration.\nIt is in the interest of all parties to avoid the cost and delay of litigation and although there are other voluntary\nways to settle disputes, they all require some compromise by those concerned.\nOne voluntary method is negotiation by calling a site meeting where all interested parties can air their grievances\nacross a table and draw up a programme of rectification and reach an agreement over responsibilities and\npayment.\nAny agreement must be recorded, signed and state what is to be done, how much is to be paid, by whom, by when,\nand how it will be accepted and checked. If no agreement can be reached then a solution may be found through\nmediation.\nThe Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 provides for a mediation service to be available to\ndwelling/house owners with eligible claims. The claiming owner and any of the other parties against whom the\nclaim is made may agree to refer the claim to mediation, with provision for binding settlements by agreement.\nThis service is restricted to leaky homes built within 10 years of the claim.\n1.5.1 \nMediation \n 1 INTRODUCTION\n 1 \n 5 \n 1 \n 1.5 \n15\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nMediation is a cost-effective, confidential, and voluntary process where the mediator is the facilitator who assists\nthe parties in reaching a negotiated agreement. Mediation concentrates on the parties' interests rather than on\ntheir rights, when often both parties realise that they are partly at fault and wish to resolve the dispute and accept\na compromise, as opposed to litigation. Any recorded settlement in a mediation agreement can be enforced as a\ncontract, but if they cannot settle, they can resort to arbitration or the courts.\nAn impartial mediator is appointed and should act independently, avoid unnecessary expenses and comply with\nthe principles of natural justice. The mediator's task is to help the parties identify the issues and options for\nsettlement and seek a settlement that is fair to all concerned. All relevant documents including specifications,\nplans, quotations, and written submissions setting out the basis of the complaint and the rebuttal by the other\nparty must be provided to the mediator.\nAfter an investigation, site visits, and discussion with all the parties, the mediator, using trade benchmarks such\nas this Code of Practice and drawing on experience can apportion responsibilities and instruct rectification work\nbe done. This method can provide a quick and inexpensive outcome with costs shared by both parties, but the\ndecision is not binding and must be mutually agreed to.\nInformal resolution of disputes does not necessarily uncover the facts; and as material or installation failures are\nnot necessarily publicly disclosed, improvement can be inhibited.\nMediation does provide the opportunity to 'move on' and does not always jeopardize business relationships as\nlitigation invariably does.\n1.5.2 \nAdjudication \nThe Construction Contracts Act allows for a dispute process called adjudication, to be the first option if\nnegotiation fails. It involves a thirty-day formal process during which the claimant appoints an adjudicator, and\nthe respondent cannot opt out. The process is designed mainly for payment disputes, but it can also be used for\nworkmanship disputes and is expected to become the normal dispute resolution method in the Construction\nIndustry.\nThe adjudicator's decision, called a determination, is binding and enforceable by the courts. An unsatisfied party\nmay only appeal an adjudication after complying with the determination. The adjudication is subject to\nconfidentiality, except by mutual consent or if the information is already in the public domain.\nThe disadvantage of both mediation and adjudication is that the faults are not published to the roofing industry,\nwho should be able to learn from the mistakes of the past.\nWhere the amount in question is under $7,500, or $12,000 by agreement with the other party, an alternative\nmethod is to file the complaint with the Disputes Tribunal. The parties usually represent themselves, without\nlawyers, and a compromise outcome is sought by a referee. This method of settlement gives no assurance of an\nequitable outcome or that the outcome will be based on technical grounds; the main purpose of this court is to\nseek agreement between the parties.\n1.5.3 \nArbitration and Litigation \nArbitration is usually a strict and formal process similar to litigation in which the parties may be legally\nrepresented, and select and pay for the arbitrator. Arbitrators must comply with the Arbitration Act; their imposed\ndecision is known as an award, and it is final and binding.\n 1 INTRODUCTION\n 1 \n 5 \n 1 \n 1.5 \n16\nThis is a controlled document.

That usually involves suing for breach of contract, non-\npayment, non-performance, faulty materials, or non-compliance. Judgment is publicly imposed and usually made\nby comparison with \"state of the art\" materials and practices available at the time the contract was signed.\nBoth arbitration and litigation can be prolonged and the parties' cost may exceed the amount in dispute.\nWhen roofing contractors sublet the contract, they assume the same responsibility as though they carried out the\nwork.\nTo avoid disputes, roofing suppliers and contractors must give adequate instruction, training, and supervision.\nThey should also keep their staff informed of industry developments and with the contents of the New Zealand\nMetal Roof and Wall Cladding Code of Practice.\n 1 INTRODUCTION\n 1 \n 5 \n 1 \n 1.5 \n17\nThis is a controlled document.

R-values rate one single material while U-values\nmeasure entire components. For example, R-values\nmeasure how much heat loss passes through\nfibreglass insulation while U-values rate how\nmuch heat can pass through a window component\n(glass, air, vinyl sash). Typical insulation might\nhave an R-value of 19 while a window might have\na U-value of 0.35.\nR = 1/U. So a U value of 0.35 would equal an R-value\nof 2.86.

Loads are derived from AS/NZS 1170, and those loads have been used to develop prescriptive\nsolutions such as found in NZS 3604, NASH, and the Code of Practice load/span tables.\n3.2.1 \nAS/AZS 1170.2:2011 \nDesigners should be familiar with the current Loadings Code, including amendments. Manufacturers' printed\ntechnical literature should comply with the current requirements of ASA/NZS 1170.\nThe Loadings Code identifies four load categories relevant to metal roof and wall cladding.\nWind actions:\nWind imposed inwards forces (pressure) where the wind is slowed, and outward pressures\n(suction) where the wind accelerates. The shape of the structure induces local pressure factors\nwhere pressure is concentrated. Internal pressures may also be generated within a building.\nPermanent action:\nDead load is the permanent weight of the roof structure and the permanent part of an imposed\nload, such as an air conditioning unit.\nImposed action:\nLive loads are variable loads imposed on the building by its occupants and contents, such as a\nperson standing on the roof (point load).\nInduced actions:\nLoads such as wind, snow or ice, and ponding rainwater.\nWhen a structure, or part of it, fails to fulfil its expected basic functions, it is said to have reached a limit state;\nthe two limit states are Serviceability Failure and Ultimate Failure. (see 3.7 Modes of Failure.)\n3.2.2 \nNZS 3604:2011 \nNZS 3604 Timber Framed Buildings is an acceptable solution to comply with the NZBC for light timber frame\nbuildings not requiring specific design.\nIt contains prescriptive dimensions for purlin spacing and fasteners, based on maximum design wind speeds of\nLow (32 m/s), Medium (37 m/s), High (44 m/s), Very High (50 m/s), or Extra High (55 m/s). The load calculations\nfor NZS3604 were based on a simplified interpretation of AS/NZS 1170. These values can be used for calculation\nof loads on the cladding of structures designed using NZS 3604.\nNZS 3604 includes:\nTimber frame construction.\nHeight from lowest ground to the highest point on the roof may not exceed 10 m.\nA snow load may not exceed 1.0 kPa, although Section 15 of NZS 3604 does provide additional criteria for\n1.5 kPa and 2.0 kPa snow loads.\nNZS 3604 excludes:\n 3 \n 3.2 STANDARDS\n 2 \n 3 \n 3.2 \n53\nThis is a controlled document.

In a roofing profile the sides of\nthe rib act as a web, and the pan and crest act as flanges.\n3.3A Profiled Steel - Flanges and Webs\nFlange\nFlange\nWeb\nFlange\nWeb\nC-Section\n-Beam\nFlange\nRoof\nLip\nSteel is strong in tension but can be weak in compression if the profile is not optimised. \nProfiled metal cladding acts as a beam, which derives its strength from the ability of its flanges, separated by the\nweb to resist tensile and compressive forces. This strength can only be maintained while those parts in\ncompression are restrained from buckling.\nThe geometry of the profile shape, together with the material thickness and strength, determines the load\ncapacity of the profile. Manufacturing variations of tested profiles will produce different results in pierced-\nfastened profiles, under load and may produce vastly different results in clip-fixed profiles.\n3.3.1 \nSection Properties \nProfile strength can be determined by analysis of sectional properties, but this will not accurately predict their\nperformance under load, as the profile shape, and therefore the sectional properties, change during deflection. \nOnly physical testing can prove the actual capabilities of the profile.\n 3 \n 3.3 PERFORMANCE\n 3 \n 3 \n 3.3 \n55\nThis is a controlled document.

Within these broad categories there are subsets.\n3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal - Minimum Depth 45 mm\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal - Minimum Depth 30 mm\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal Low Rib - Minimum Depth 19mm\nCorrugate - Minimum Depth 16.5mm\nTrapezoidal Symmetrical - Minimum Depth 19 mm\nSymmetrical corrugate or trapezoidal profiles have the advantage of being more easily curved around a radius.\nBecause the ribs are necessarily close together, they have the disadvantage of roof traffic loads having to be\nspread over two crests, and they have a lower run-off capacity.\n3.4.1 \nCorrugate Profile \nThe corrugated profile has been used in New Zealand for over 150 years and there has been only one significant\nchange during that period.\nIn the 1960s the steel grade used for roof and wall cladding changed from low-strength steel (250MPa or G250) \nto high-strength steel (550 MPa or G550). The number of corrugations also changed from 8 to 10.5, which enabled\nthe sheets to be laid either side up, as opposed to over-and-under.\nThe standard corrugation profile has 17.5 mm deep crests at 76 mm spacings, but smaller and deeper alternatives\nare also available.\nCorrugate cladding is formed with a slightly asymmetrical overlap profile to a capillary barrier.\n3.4.2 \nTrapezoidal Profile \nThe trapezoidal shape provides greater water carrying capacity and provides greater spanning capabilities than\ncorrugate profile.\n 3 \n 3.4 PROFILES\n 3 \n 3.4 \n56\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nThe angle and height of the trapezoid rib determines the profiles performance under compression. A deeper rib\ngenerally gives improved performance, but lowers the effective coverage of the sheet.\nTrapezoidal profiles are available with different ribs heights (see 3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles).\n3.4.3 \nMiniature Profiles \nVarious miniature cladding profiles are manufactured in New Zealand, the most common being known variously\nunder the names of mini-corrugate, sparrow iron, baby iron and mini-iron.\nMini-corrugate is sometimes used for small roof areas, such as spires and awnings. It is most commonly used\nfor wall cladding, parapets and internal linings where studs are normally spaced at 600 mm centres or less.\nSome miniature trapezoidal profiles are also manufactured specifically for wall cladding.\n3.4.4 \nSecret-fixed Profiles \n3.4.4A Secret-fixed Profiles\nTrough Profile - Minimum Depth 38mm\nTray may be profiled\nStanding Seam/Tray Profile - \nMinimum Depth 25 mm\nSecret fixed profiles are attached to the structure by clips rather than by pierce fasteners. This allows for freer\nthermal movement and minimises the number of penetrations in the cladding. The steep sided ribs and wide pans\ntypical of secret fixed profiles gives greater water carrying capacity, and facilitates watertight flashing design.\nTraditionally they were used for pitches as low as 1 deg but due to durability issues caused by deflection and\nresultant ponding the recommended minimum pitch is now 3 deg .\nTrough sections generally have 2 to 3 pans or trays 180 - 250 mm in width. Tray roofing has a single pan of up to\n550 mm in width.\nStanding Seam is a subset of tray roofing. Standing seam roofs are based on traditional manufacturing methods\n(using folding and hand tool rather than roll forming), but now they are available roll-formed in most itirations.\n(See 15.4 Tray Roofing)\n3.4.5 \nMaterial Grade \n 3 \n 3.4 PROFILES\n 3 \n 3.4 \n57\nThis is a controlled document.

Elongation is also measured\nduring this test.\nThe minimum tensile strength defines the grade of steel, eg, G550 for high-strength light gauge steel, but to\ncomply with this grade the yield strength and elongation must also fall within defined parameters.\nYield strength is an important determinant of the strength of a profile, along with profile shape and material\nthickness. High tensile material will have more resistance to failure such as buckling around the fastener under\nwind uplift, pull-through of the fastener head, or buckling under foot traffic load. However, tensile strength has a\nnegligible effect on deflection under load.\nWhere 0.55 material is specified for straight corrugate or trapezoidal roofing, it is unacceptable to substitute\nG300 for G550 grade material as the resultant profile will have little strength advantage over 0.40 mm G550.\nAluminium is defined by a hardness grade ranging from H32 to H38. Typically, H34 is used for flashings, severe\nprofiles such as trough sections, and profiles that are to be curved. Most corrugated and Trapezoidal profiles are\nmanufactured using H36.\nIt must be remembered that the alloy also affects strength. H36 aluminium in 5005 or 5025 alloys, which are\ntypically used in New Zealand, will have considerably greater tensile strength than the same grade in a 3000-\nseries alloy.\n3.4.5A End Use for Typical Alloys\nMaterial\nGradeTypical End Use\nSteel\nG300 Flashings, ridging, spouting, curving, some trough sections.\nG550 Corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, some trough sections.\nAluminium 5505/5025H32\nLock seaming\nH34\nFlashings, curved roofing, trough sections, and tray roofing.\nH 36 Flashings and profiled roofing, trapezoidal sections, and corrugate.\n 3 \n 3.4 PROFILES\n 3 \n 3.4 \n58\nThis is a controlled document.

For residential buildings, 0.40\nmm thickness material is most commonly used for corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, and this will normally be\nsufficient to withstand the statutory wind loads at typical spans and fastener spacings in up to High Wind\n 3 \n 3.4 PROFILES\n 3 \n 3.4 \n60\nThis is a controlled document.

In higher wind speeds, it is often more effective to use 0.55 mm material, rather than reducing purlin and\nfastener spacings.\nMaterial with a 0.40 mm thickness is very vulnerable to foot traffic damage in most profile configurations and\nrequires careful and accurate foot placement to avoid buckling. In residential buildings with high foot traffic\nexpectancy or highly visible roofs, eg, multi-level mono-pitch roofs, roofs with UV collectors, flues, aircon\ndevices, chimneys that need servicing, or prestige housing 0.55 mm material should be selected.\nFor commercial and industrial applications, 0.55 mm is almost universally used on the roof, and 0.40 mm is most\ncommon on walls.\nIn addition to 0.40 mm and 0.55 mm, 0.48 mm G550 steel is often used for high tensile trough sections, which will\noften compare in strength to similar profiles manufactured from 0.55 mm G300 material. Most roofing profiles\ncan also be manufactured from 0.75 mm G550 material where greater robustness and resistance to foot traffic\nare desired.\nMaterial is available with other thicknesses; for example, 0.63 mm material is often manufactured for the Pacific\nislands, and 0.35 mm is sometimes used to manufacture specialist wall cladding.\n 3 \n 3.4 PROFILES\n 3 \n 3.4 \n61\nThis is a controlled document.

These loads can be broadly categorised as point load and uniformly distributed\nload (UDL).\nModes of failure and fastener loads are discussed in other clauses under the main clause 3 Structure.\n3.5.1 \nUnderstanding Loads \nThe performance of profiled metal cladding under load depends on its ability to resist the tension (stretching),\ncompression (squashing), and shear (sliding) forces that it is likely to be subjected to during the lifetime of the\nbuilding.\n3.5.1A Compression, Tensile and Shear Force\nCOMPRESSION\nTENSION\nSHEAR\nLoad\nForce\nWhen a beam is subjected to bending, one flange will be under compression and the other under tension.\nLoads acting on roof cladding are generally classified into two types: point load and uniformly distributed load\n(UDL). A point load is applied to a particular area, but a UDL impacts on the total area of the roof.\n3.5.1.1 \nContinuity \nOptimum performance of roof cladding under load depends on the continuity over several spans.\nAn adjacent continuous span assists the performance of profiled metal cladding, as continuity can\nreduce deflection up to 50%. In single spans the cladding is free to rotate at each support, but with\ncontinuity at a support the cladding is held down by an adjacent span; reducing the rotation and\ndeflection.\n 3 \n 3.5 LOADS\n 5 \n 3 \n 3.5 \n62\nThis is a controlled document.

A load distributed equally along the length of a beam (line load)\nwill cause less deflection than the same load being applied to the centre of the beam.\n3.5.1.2A Little deflection with a line load.\n10\n 3 \n 3.5 LOADS\n 5 \n 3 \n 3.5 \n63\nThis is a controlled document.

Given the same cross section area, the deflection of the profile will vary with the square of the\ndepth, with the trade-off of higher buckling modes.\n3.5.1.2C Deflection and the Square of Depth\nFORCE\nFORCE\nFORCE\nDeflection \n16x\nDeflection \n4x\nDeflection \nx\n100\n25\n200\n50\n100\n50\n 3 \n 3.5 LOADS\n 5 \n 3 \n 3.5 \n64\nThis is a controlled document.

A point load is applied to a particular area, but a UDL\nimpacts on the total area of the roof.\n3.6.1 \nPoint Load \nMost roofing profiles will resist far greater point loads when the load is applied to the pan of the profile rather\nthan the rib. When the load is applied to the pan, the load is shared by the adjacent ribs. Alternatively, loads may\nbe applied over two or more ribs.\nTesting loads may be applied to the pan or the rib depending of the profile shape and the design criteria. See \n3.7.4 Roof Traffic.\nTrafficable roofs must be designed to withstand a point load which is representative of a worker with a bag of\ntools. It is calculated at 112 kg, which equals 1.1 kN force.\nIn the case of an imposed load, such as an air conditioning unit which is supported directly by the roof cladding,\nthe unit weight per support and area of contact is calculated to arrive at point loads.\nA point load on a roof is always positive or downward (+).\n 3 \n 3.6 TYPES OF LOAD\n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n65\nThis is a controlled document.

The most severe wind load is usually an\nuplift load, or negative (-), and snow load is a downward load or positive (+).\n3.6.2.1 \nWind Load \nThe wind load imposed on a roof structure is taken to apply at right angles to the roof cladding over a nominated\narea. The design wind load is affected by the design of the building and is modified using factors called pressure\ncoefficients. Wind design load is measured in kilopascal (kPa); 1 kPa equals 1 kN/m. \n 3 \n 3.6 TYPES OF LOAD\n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n66\nThis is a controlled document.

Structures near the crest of a rise or on flat land near a steep face will have increased\ndesign wind pressure.\nWind Design Load is affected by building design factors such as building height, shape, proportions, orientation,\nand roof pitch. Permeability can also be a big factor; buildings with large openings on one side but completely\nclosed on the other three sides will suffer high internal wind pressures. These internal pressures must be added\nto the suction load on the outside of the roof when calculating wind design load.\nLocal territorial authorities are usually able to give wind speed figures for a specific address in their area. All\nother factors, including topographical influences, internal, and local pressure factors must be considered by a\nsuitably qualified professional to calculate the design wind load on a structure.\n 3 \n 3.6 TYPES OF LOAD\n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n68\nThis is a controlled document.

The\nperipheral areas of roof and wall surfaces are subjected to greater uplift loads than the main body of the roof.\nDesigners need to include local pressure factors in the calculation of wind loads on the cladding.\nWhen determining fixing requirements to NZS 1170.2, the engineer should prepare a roof map showing purlin\nspans and local pressure factors for each section of the cladding.\nWhen designing to NZS 1170 the local pressure factors are:\n1.5-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.2 or 20% of the width or height of the\nbuilding whichever is the least.\n2.0-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.1 or 10% of the width or height whichever is\nthe least.\n3.0-applied to roof pitches less than 10 deg , at the corners where the dimensions in (a) intersect.

However, to get a true\ndesign wind speed is a lot more complex; various factors have to be applied including roof self-weight, internal\npressure and local pressure coefficients. \nThe most influential of these factors is generally the local pressure factor, but internal pressure can also have a\nprofound influence-particularly on unlined structures.\n3.6.2.2 \nSnow Loads \nRoof cladding design does not usually have to be altered for snow load, maximum snow load in New Zealand\n(under NZS 3604) is a UDL of 2 kPa.This is less than the upwards load in a Very High Wind Zone, however, as it is\na downwards load, restraint is linear by the purlins, rather than point restraint by the fasteners, so greater capacity\nis achieved.\nAny profile-gauge combination that will resist a wind load of Very High or Extra High Wind Zone with fasteners at\neach crest, will adequately resist a 2 kPa snow load. It may, however, be neccessary to increase the strength of\nthe structure to allow for induced snow loads.\nNZS 3604 divides New Zealand into six zones where the maximum snow load is 2 kPa; areas above specific\naltitudes in these areas require specific design.\n 3 \n 3.6 TYPES OF LOAD\n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n70\nThis is a controlled document.

It is normal to fit snow straps to residential gutters in snow prone areas.\n3.6.2.3 \nRoof Weight \nThe self-weight of light-weight profiled sheet cladding should be included in the calculation of net wind load, but\nis a minor factor and, typically, works in the opposite direction to wind loads.\n3.6.2.2A Snow Loadings Map\nAuckland\n0\n1\n2\n3\n5\nTaupo\nTurangi\nNew Plymouth\nOpotiki\nWellington\nNelson\nWestport\nGreymouth\nOmarama\nDunedin\nAlexandra\nChristchurch\nCheviot\nMilford \nSound\n3.6.2.2B Altitudes for Snow\nLoading Design\nMaximum Altitude as per NZS 3604\nZone Up to:\n1.0 kPa\n1.5 kPa\n2.0kPa\n0\nNot Required\n1\n400\n600\n850\n2\n400\n600\n850\n3\n400\n600\n850\n100\n200\n350\n5\n200\n300\n400\n 3 \n 3.6 TYPES OF LOAD\n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n71\nThis is a controlled document.

While the cladding can still resist a load, this permanent deformation is liable to cause leakage at\nthat point; therefore, it is a serviceability failure and is often the limit state for trapezoidal profiles. Medium and\nhigh rib trapezoidals may have ultimate loads as the determining factor.\nFailure under wind load for clip-fastened cladding is usually by the clips de-indexing and the cladding sheets\nblowing off. This is an ultimate failure.\nIf a standard corrugate or low rib trapezoidal product passes UDL for serviceability it will comfortably exceed\nultimate design load requirements. For medium and high ribbed trapezoidal, both serviceability and strength loads\nshould be checked. Clip-fastened products are typically restricted by strength load only.\nPoint load resistance should also be checked against the expected roof traffic load of the finished structure. \n(See 3.7.4 Roof Traffic)\n3.7.2 \nDeflection \nDeflection is the temporary bending of roof or wall cladding that occurs under load when the material is subjected\nto forces within its elastic limits.\nDeflection under distributed load is a voluntary limit of wall cladding, deformation causing residual deflection\nafter application of point load is a serviceability failure of roofing.\nTemporary deflection under load is not considered for roof load tables as it has not been found to affect\nweathertightness. Temporary deflection under load of wall cladding is a recommended limitation for aesthetic\nreasons, but it is not mandatory.\n3.7.3 \nDeformation \nDeformation is a permanent alteration to the profile's shape that occurs when the material is taken beyond its\nelastic limits. This is most often seen as deformation under the fastener head after high outwards loads, or\nbuckling of the rib after the imposition of a point load\n 3 \n 3.7 MODES OF FAILURE\n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n72\nThis is a controlled document.

This should be considered at the design stage. Machine roll-curved, crimp-\ncurved cladding, and metal roof tiles are usually made from low-strength steels. \nIt is not acceptable for G300 steel to be substituted for G550 steel in products that are traditionally run from high-\ntensile strength material.\n3.7.4 \nRoof Traffic \nThe designer must consider the degree and type of foot traffic that may be expected on a roof. The following\nrequirements are subjective standards and must be considered in line with customer expectations, and building\nuse and type.\nMore robust design than specified below (reducing purlin spacing or adding protection from mechanical\naction), is required for roofs that are regularly accessed, roofs used as staging by subsequent trades, or\nareas that are adjacent to access points, particularly step down access.\nType A - Unrestricted Access\nType A are roofs:\nthat need to be regularly traversed by the roofer for access during installation;\nthat will be accessed regularly by sub-trades;\nthat butt on to walls or windows that may require maintenance;\n3.7.3A Deformation Around a Fastener\nHead\n3.7.3B Permanent Damage Around\nFastener Head\n 3 \n 3.7 MODES OF FAILURE\n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n73\nThis is a controlled document.

Any\nattachment to the roof cladding must be compatible with the cladding, or isolated from it.\n 3 \n 3.7 MODES OF FAILURE\n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n74\nThis is a controlled document.

Depending on\nthe method and sequence of construction, it can be greater than the load on a completed building. Construction\nloads also include temporary localised loads from material storage, scaffolding, and tradespeople.\nOther forces contributing to construction load include:\nThe intensity of internal wind pressures due to a temporary absence of ceilings, walls and glazing.\nStorage of roof cladding on the structure. Bundles of roof cladding should be placed so they do not cause\noverstress in purlins.\nAny scaffolding above an existing roof must be designed to avoid damage to the roof structure or coatings,\nand be designed or sequenced to avoid wet storage corrosion. It is far better practice to stage jobs so that\nlower roofs are not used as a working platform for work on higher levels\n 3 \n 3.7 MODES OF FAILURE\n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n75\nThis is a controlled document.

Aluminium brackets and clips\nhave been known to fail by fatigue and this should be considered in designing such items.\nOther metals, such as lead and copper, are restricted in length or overall panel size to avoid cracking by fatigue.\nSharply folded corners should be avoided on these materials and the minimum radii requirements should be\nfollowed.\nHydrogen embrittlement can occur when folded items such as external gutter brackets are subjected to post-\nforming hot dip galvanizing. This can be avoided by forming to radii appropriate to the material grade and\nthickness being formed.\n3.7.6A Typical Rib Damage Due to\nPoint Load\n3.7.6B Severe Damage Causing Splitting\n 3 \n 3.7 MODES OF FAILURE\n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n76\nThis is a controlled document.

Testing procedures are designed to\nclosely simulate these conditions.\nProduct testing does not include pull-out of the screw, this should be checked independently.\n3.8.1 \nFastener Loads \nFastener failure by fatigue can occur when fasteners embedded in timber or hot rolled steel, are subject to\nfrequent bending action by repeated thermal expansion forces. This is unlikely to happen to cold rolled steel\npurlins up to 2.5 mm in thickness as the thinner depth of connection of the screw into the purlin allows it to\nrotate, rather than bend.\n3.8.1A Fasteners - Mechanical Properties\nA\nB\nC\nA.

When fastening into light gauge steel, the pull-out values of the specified screw must be\nconsidered, and the installation must be completed with that type, gauge, and brand of screw. In light gauge steel\nunder 1mm in thickness, it is also important to avoid stripping out the formed screw thread\n3.8.3 \nTimber Purlins \nTimber purlins generally require a fastener penetration of 30 mm. With this level of embedment, a screw equipped\nwith a profiled washer though 0.55 material will fail by pull-through of the cladding before it fails by fastener\nwithdrawal from the timber. Greater thicknesses of cladding may require specific design. For fastening into\nsarking or rigid air barrier less than 30 mm thick, the pull-out values for the specific screw and sarking material\nshould be obtained from the supplier and required fastener pattern calculated.\n3.8.4 \nPull-over Values \nPull-over values for medium and high rib trapezoidal profiles must be checked against strength\nloads provided by testing.\nPull-over load depends on the head or washer size. For example, as 12# and 14# screw heads have\napproximately the same diameter, these screw sizes have the same design load value for pull-over.\nIf the pullover load is likely to be exceeded, the options are to increase the metal thickness or use a\nload-spreading washer.\n3.8.5 \nLoad-spreading Washers \nProfiled load-spreading washers spread high wind uplift-loads over a larger area around the fastener head. Using\nload spreading washers under the fastener can increase the load resistance of each fastener by up to 50%.\nThe type, size and stiffness of washers are critical for performance. Where performance data incorporating load-\nspreading washers is used, the specification of the washer must be quoted with the fastener.\nIn general, load-spreading washers should have a minimum thickness of 0.95 mm for steel and 1.2 mm for non-\nferrous metal.\n 3 \n 3.8 FASTENERS\n 8 \n 3 \n 3.8 \n78\nThis is a controlled document.

They should be read in conjunction with the point load limitations appropriate to\nthe degree of traffic predicted on the roof.\n3.11.1 \nFastener Pull-out \nNZMRM wind uplift resistance testing specifically assumes fasteners are permanently fixed to the purlins and will\nnot pull out. Because of this and, also due to the huge range of fastener/purlin material variations, the pull-out\nresistance of fasteners is eliminated from the uplift testing procedure. Accordingly, when designing for SED wind\nconditions, the engineer must make a separate calculation to determine the necessary pull-out resistance of the\nfastener from the purlin material to be used, which will allow the correct selection of the fasteners.\n3.11.2 \nSteel Cladding Wind Load Span Graphs \nThe performance of profiled metal cladding depends on the profile shape, thickness of the metal, the span, and\nthe fastening type and pattern. These values can be greatly enhanced by using load spreading washers or thicker\nmaterial.\nAll the tests from which these graphs have been derived used the 2:3 ratio of end to intermediate span and the\ngraphs shown are for intermediate spans only. End spans must be reduced by two-thirds for these values to be\nassumed.\n 3 \n 3.11 WIND LOAD/SPAN GRAPHS - DESIGNS TO AS/NZS1170\n 11 \n 3 \n 3.11 \n89\nThis is a controlled document.

        "content": "3.4 \nProfiles \nProfile familes can broadly be segregated as pierce fastened (corrugate, trapezoidal), and secret fix (tray and\ntrough). Within these broad categories there are subsets.\n3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal - Minimum Depth 45 mm\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal - Minimum Depth 30 mm\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal Low Rib - Minimum Depth 19mm\nCorrugate - Minimum Depth 16.5mm\nTrapezoidal Symmetrical - Minimum Depth 19 mm\nSymmetrical corrugate or trapezoidal profiles have the advantage of being more easily curved around a radius.\nBecause the ribs are necessarily close together, they have the disadvantage of roof traffic loads having to be\nspread over two crests, and they have a lower run-off capacity.\n3.4.1 \nCorrugate Profile \nThe corrugated profile has been used in New Zealand for over 150 years and there has been only one significant\nchange during that period.\nIn the 1960s the steel grade used for roof and wall cladding changed from low-strength steel (250MPa or G250) \nto high-strength steel (550 MPa or G550). The number of corrugations also changed from 8 to 10.5, which enabled\nthe sheets to be laid either side up, as opposed to over-and-under.\nThe standard corrugation profile has 17.5 mm deep crests at 76 mm spacings, but smaller and deeper alternatives\nare also available.\nCorrugate cladding is formed with a slightly asymmetrical overlap profile to a capillary barrier.\n3.4.2 \nTrapezoidal Profile \nThe trapezoidal shape provides greater water carrying capacity and provides greater spanning capabilities than\ncorrugate profile.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 3 \n 3.4 \n56\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nThe angle and height of the trapezoid rib determines the profiles performance under compression. A deeper rib\ngenerally gives improved performance, but lowers the effective coverage of the sheet.\nTrapezoidal profiles are available with different ribs heights (see 3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles).\n3.4.3 \nMiniature Profiles \nVarious miniature cladding profiles are manufactured in New Zealand, the most common being known variously\nunder the names of mini-corrugate, sparrow iron, baby iron and mini-iron.\nMini-corrugate is sometimes used for small roof areas, such as spires and awnings. It is most commonly used\nfor wall cladding, parapets and internal linings where studs are normally spaced at 600 mm centres or less.\nSome miniature trapezoidal profiles are also manufactured specifically for wall cladding.\n3.4.4 \nSecret-fixed Profiles \n3.4.4A Secret-fixed Profiles\nTrough Profile - Minimum Depth 38mm\nTray may be profiled\nStanding Seam/Tray Profile - \nMinimum Depth 25 mm\nSecret fixed profiles are attached to the structure by clips rather than by pierce fasteners. This allows for freer\nthermal movement and minimises the number of penetrations in the cladding. The steep sided ribs and wide pans\ntypical of secret fixed profiles gives greater water carrying capacity, and facilitates watertight flashing design.\nTraditionally they were used for pitches as low as 1 deg but due to durability issues caused by deflection and\nresultant ponding the recommended minimum pitch is now 3 deg .\nTrough sections generally have 2 to 3 pans or trays 180 - 250 mm in width. Tray roofing has a single pan of up to\n550 mm in width.\nStanding Seam is a subset of tray roofing. Standing seam roofs are based on traditional manufacturing methods\n(using folding and hand tool rather than roll forming), but now they are available roll-formed in most itirations.\n(See 15.4 Tray Roofing)\n3.4.5 \nMaterial Grade \n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 3 \n 3.4 \n57\nThis is a controlled document.

Elongation is also measured\nduring this test.\nThe minimum tensile strength defines the grade of steel, eg, G550 for high-strength light gauge steel, but to\ncomply with this grade the yield strength and elongation must also fall within defined parameters.\nYield strength is an important determinant of the strength of a profile, along with profile shape and material\nthickness. High tensile material will have more resistance to failure such as buckling around the fastener under\nwind uplift, pull-through of the fastener head, or buckling under foot traffic load. However, tensile strength has a\nnegligible effect on deflection under load.\nWhere 0.55 material is specified for straight corrugate or trapezoidal roofing, it is unacceptable to substitute\nG300 for G550 grade material as the resultant profile will have little strength advantage over 0.40 mm G550.\nAluminium is defined by a hardness grade ranging from H32 to H38. Typically, H34 is used for flashings, severe\nprofiles such as trough sections, and profiles that are to be curved. Most corrugated and Trapezoidal profiles are\nmanufactured using H36.\nIt must be remembered that the alloy also affects strength. H36 aluminium in 5005 or 5025 alloys, which are\ntypically used in New Zealand, will have considerably greater tensile strength than the same grade in a 3000-\nseries alloy.\n3.4.5A End Use for Typical Alloys\nMaterial\nGradeTypical End Use\nSteel\nG300 Flashings, ridging, spouting, curving, some trough sections.\nG550 Corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, some trough sections.\nAluminium 5505/5025H32\nLock seaming\nH34\nFlashings, curved roofing, trough sections, and tray roofing.\nH 36 Flashings and profiled roofing, trapezoidal sections, and corrugate.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 3 \n 3.4 \n58\nThis is a controlled document.

In higher wind speeds, it is often more effective to use 0.55 mm material, rather than reducing purlin and\nfastener spacings.\nMaterial with a 0.40 mm thickness is very vulnerable to foot traffic damage in most profile configurations and\nrequires careful and accurate foot placement to avoid buckling. In residential buildings with high foot traffic\nexpectancy or highly visible roofs, eg, multi-level mono-pitch roofs, roofs with UV collectors, flues, aircon\ndevices, chimneys that need servicing, or prestige housing 0.55 mm material should be selected.\nFor commercial and industrial applications, 0.55 mm is almost universally used on the roof, and 0.40 mm is most\ncommon on walls.\nIn addition to 0.40 mm and 0.55 mm, 0.48 mm G550 steel is often used for high tensile trough sections, which will\noften compare in strength to similar profiles manufactured from 0.55 mm G300 material. Most roofing profiles\ncan also be manufactured from 0.75 mm G550 material where greater robustness and resistance to foot traffic\nare desired.\nMaterial is available with other thicknesses; for example, 0.63 mm material is often manufactured for the Pacific\nislands, and 0.35 mm is sometimes used to manufacture specialist wall cladding.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 3 \n 3.4 \n61\nThis is a controlled document.

High tensile material will have more resistance to failure such as buckling around the fastener under\nwind uplift, pull-through of the fastener head, or buckling under foot traffic load. However, tensile strength has a\nnegligible effect on deflection under load.\nWhere 0.55 material is specified for straight corrugate or trapezoidal roofing, it is unacceptable to substitute\nG300 for G550 grade material as the resultant profile will have little strength advantage over 0.40 mm G550.\nAluminium is defined by a hardness grade ranging from H32 to H38.

These loads can be broadly categorised as point load and uniformly distributed\nload (UDL).\nModes of failure and fastener loads are discussed in other clauses under the main clause 3 Structure.\n3.5.1 \nUnderstanding Loads \nThe performance of profiled metal cladding under load depends on its ability to resist the tension (stretching),\ncompression (squashing), and shear (sliding) forces that it is likely to be subjected to during the lifetime of the\nbuilding.\n3.5.1A Compression, Tensile and Shear Force\nCOMPRESSION\nTENSION\nSHEAR\nLoad\nForce\nWhen a beam is subjected to bending, one flange will be under compression and the other under tension.\nLoads acting on roof cladding are generally classified into two types: point load and uniformly distributed load\n(UDL). A point load is applied to a particular area, but a UDL impacts on the total area of the roof.\n3.5.1.1 \nContinuity \nOptimum performance of roof cladding under load depends on the continuity over several spans.\nAn adjacent continuous span assists the performance of profiled metal cladding, as continuity can\nreduce deflection up to 50%. In single spans the cladding is free to rotate at each support, but with\ncontinuity at a support the cladding is held down by an adjacent span; reducing the rotation and\ndeflection.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 5 \n 3 \n 3.5 \n62\nThis is a controlled document.

The most severe wind load is usually an\nuplift load, or negative (-), and snow load is a downward load or positive (+).\n3.6.2.1 \nWind Load \nThe wind load imposed on a roof structure is taken to apply at right angles to the roof cladding over a nominated\narea.

Structures near the crest of a rise or on flat land near a steep face will have increased\ndesign wind pressure.\nWind Design Load is affected by building design factors such as building height, shape, proportions, orientation,\nand roof pitch. Permeability can also be a big factor; buildings with large openings on one side but completely\nclosed on the other three sides will suffer high internal wind pressures. These internal pressures must be added\nto the suction load on the outside of the roof when calculating wind design load.\nLocal territorial authorities are usually able to give wind speed figures for a specific address in their area. All\nother factors, including topographical influences, internal, and local pressure factors must be considered by a\nsuitably qualified professional to calculate the design wind load on a structure.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n68\nThis is a controlled document.

The\nperipheral areas of roof and wall surfaces are subjected to greater uplift loads than the main body of the roof.\nDesigners need to include local pressure factors in the calculation of wind loads on the cladding.\nWhen determining fixing requirements to NZS 1170.2, the engineer should prepare a roof map showing purlin\nspans and local pressure factors for each section of the cladding.\nWhen designing to NZS 1170 the local pressure factors are:\n1.5-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.2 or 20% of the width or height of the\nbuilding whichever is the least.\n2.0-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.1 or 10% of the width or height whichever is\nthe least.\n3.0-applied to roof pitches less than 10 deg , at the corners where the dimensions in (a) intersect. It also applies\nto corners of walls where the building height is greater than the building width.\n3.6.2.1.1A Local Pressure for Low-Pitch Roofs\na = Lesser of:\nLocal Pressure (Kl) factors as per AS/NZS 1170:2011\nKl 1.5\nKl 2.0\nKl 3.0\nY\nX\nPitch <10 deg \nRidge\nPitches below 10 deg do not have local pressure factors at the ridge\na\na\n0.5 x Building Height, or\n0.2 x Building width, or\n0.2 x Building length\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n69\nThis is a controlled document.

However, to get a true\ndesign wind speed is a lot more complex; various factors have to be applied including roof self-weight, internal\npressure and local pressure coefficients. \nThe most influential of these factors is generally the local pressure factor, but internal pressure can also have a\nprofound influence-particularly on unlined structures.\n3.6.2.2 \nSnow Loads \nRoof cladding design does not usually have to be altered for snow load, maximum snow load in New Zealand\n(under NZS 3604) is a UDL of 2 kPa.This is less than the upwards load in a Very High Wind Zone, however, as it is\na downwards load, restraint is linear by the purlins, rather than point restraint by the fasteners, so greater capacity\nis achieved.\nAny profile-gauge combination that will resist a wind load of Very High or Extra High Wind Zone with fasteners at\neach crest, will adequately resist a 2 kPa snow load. It may, however, be neccessary to increase the strength of\nthe structure to allow for induced snow loads.\nNZS 3604 divides New Zealand into six zones where the maximum snow load is 2 kPa; areas above specific\naltitudes in these areas require specific design.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n70\nThis is a controlled document.

It is normal to fit snow straps to residential gutters in snow prone areas.\n3.6.2.3 \nRoof Weight \nThe self-weight of light-weight profiled sheet cladding should be included in the calculation of net wind load, but\nis a minor factor and, typically, works in the opposite direction to wind loads.\n3.6.2.2A Snow Loadings Map\nAuckland\n0\n1\n2\n3\n5\nTaupo\nTurangi\nNew Plymouth\nOpotiki\nWellington\nNelson\nWestport\nGreymouth\nOmarama\nDunedin\nAlexandra\nChristchurch\nCheviot\nMilford \nSound\n3.6.2.2B Altitudes for Snow\nLoading Design\nMaximum Altitude as per NZS 3604\nZone Up to:\n1.0 kPa\n1.5 kPa\n2.0kPa\n0\nNot Required\n1\n400\n600\n850\n2\n400\n600\n850\n3\n400\n600\n850\n100\n200\n350\n5\n200\n300\n400\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 6 \n 3 \n 3.6 \n71\nThis is a controlled document.

While the cladding can still resist a load, this permanent deformation is liable to cause leakage at\nthat point; therefore, it is a serviceability failure and is often the limit state for trapezoidal profiles. Medium and\nhigh rib trapezoidals may have ultimate loads as the determining factor.\nFailure under wind load for clip-fastened cladding is usually by the clips de-indexing and the cladding sheets\nblowing off. This is an ultimate failure.\nIf a standard corrugate or low rib trapezoidal product passes UDL for serviceability it will comfortably exceed\nultimate design load requirements. For medium and high ribbed trapezoidal, both serviceability and strength loads\nshould be checked. Clip-fastened products are typically restricted by strength load only.\nPoint load resistance should also be checked against the expected roof traffic load of the finished structure. \n(See 3.7.4 Roof Traffic)\n3.7.2 \nDeflection \nDeflection is the temporary bending of roof or wall cladding that occurs under load when the material is subjected\nto forces within its elastic limits.\nDeflection under distributed load is a voluntary limit of wall cladding, deformation causing residual deflection\nafter application of point load is a serviceability failure of roofing.\nTemporary deflection under load is not considered for roof load tables as it has not been found to affect\nweathertightness. Temporary deflection under load of wall cladding is a recommended limitation for aesthetic\nreasons, but it is not mandatory.\n3.7.3 \nDeformation \nDeformation is a permanent alteration to the profile's shape that occurs when the material is taken beyond its\nelastic limits. This is most often seen as deformation under the fastener head after high outwards loads, or\nbuckling of the rib after the imposition of a point load\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n72\nThis is a controlled document.

This should be considered at the design stage. Machine roll-curved, crimp-\ncurved cladding, and metal roof tiles are usually made from low-strength steels. \nIt is not acceptable for G300 steel to be substituted for G550 steel in products that are traditionally run from high-\ntensile strength material.\n3.7.4 \nRoof Traffic \nThe designer must consider the degree and type of foot traffic that may be expected on a roof. The following\nrequirements are subjective standards and must be considered in line with customer expectations, and building\nuse and type.\nMore robust design than specified below (reducing purlin spacing or adding protection from mechanical\naction), is required for roofs that are regularly accessed, roofs used as staging by subsequent trades, or\nareas that are adjacent to access points, particularly step down access.\nType A - Unrestricted Access\nType A are roofs:\nthat need to be regularly traversed by the roofer for access during installation;\nthat will be accessed regularly by sub-trades;\nthat butt on to walls or windows that may require maintenance;\n3.7.3A Deformation Around a Fastener\nHead\n3.7.3B Permanent Damage Around\nFastener Head\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 7 \n 3 \n 3.7 \n73\nThis is a controlled document.

Depending on\nthe method and sequence of construction, it can be greater than the load on a completed building. Construction\nloads also include temporary localised loads from material storage, scaffolding, and tradespeople.\nOther forces contributing to construction load include:\nThe intensity of internal wind pressures due to a temporary absence of ceilings, walls and glazing.\nStorage of roof cladding on the structure. Bundles of roof cladding should be placed so they do not cause\noverstress in purlins.\nAny scaffolding above an existing roof must be designed to avoid damage to the roof structure or coatings,\nand be designed or sequenced to avoid wet storage corrosion.

Aluminium brackets and clips\nhave been known to fail by fatigue and this should be considered in designing such items.\nOther metals, such as lead and copper, are restricted in length or overall panel size to avoid cracking by fatigue.\nSharply folded corners should be avoided on these materials and the minimum radii requirements should be\nfollowed.\nHydrogen embrittlement can occur when folded items such as external gutter brackets are subjected to post-\nforming hot dip galvanizing.

Where performance data incorporating load-\nspreading washers is used, the specification of the washer must be quoted with the fastener.\nIn general, load-spreading washers should have a minimum thickness of 0.95 mm for steel and 1.2 mm for non-\nferrous metal.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 3.8 FASTENERS\n 8 \n 3 \n 3.8 \n78\nThis is a controlled document.

They should be read in conjunction with the point load limitations appropriate to\nthe degree of traffic predicted on the roof.\n3.11.1 \nFastener Pull-out \nNZMRM wind uplift resistance testing specifically assumes fasteners are permanently fixed to the purlins and will\nnot pull out. Because of this and, also due to the huge range of fastener/purlin material variations, the pull-out\nresistance of fasteners is eliminated from the uplift testing procedure. Accordingly, when designing for SED wind\nconditions, the engineer must make a separate calculation to determine the necessary pull-out resistance of the\nfastener from the purlin material to be used, which will allow the correct selection of the fasteners.\n3.11.2 \nSteel Cladding Wind Load Span Graphs \nThe performance of profiled metal cladding depends on the profile shape, thickness of the metal, the span, and\nthe fastening type and pattern. These values can be greatly enhanced by using load spreading washers or thicker\nmaterial.\nAll the tests from which these graphs have been derived used the 2:3 ratio of end to intermediate span and the\ngraphs shown are for intermediate spans only. End spans must be reduced by two-thirds for these values to be\nassumed.\n 3 STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 11 \n 3 \n 3.11 \n89\nThis is a controlled document.

The life of the building, being not less than 50 years, if:\nthose building elements (including floors, walls, and fixings) provide structural stability to the building; or\nthose building elements are difficult to access or replace; or\nfailure of those building elements to comply with the building code would go undetected during both\nnormal use and maintenance of the building.\nb. 15 years if:\nthose building elements (including the building envelope, exposed plumbing in the subfloor space, and in-\nbuilt chimneys and flues) are moderately difficult to access or replace; or\nfailure of those building elements to comply with the building code would go undetected during normal\nuse of the building, but would be easily detected during normal maintenance.\nc. 5 years if:\nthe building elements (including services, linings, renewable protective coatings, and fixtures) are easy to\naccess and replace; and\nfailure of those building elements to comply with the building code would be easily detected during normal\nuse of the building.\nIndividual building elements which are components of a building system and are difficult to access or replace\nmust either:\nall have the same durability; or\nbe installed in a manner that permits the replacement of building elements of lesser durability without\nremoving building elements that have greater durability and are not specifically designed for removal and\n 4.1 NZBC CLAUSE B2 (EXTRACT)\n 1 \n 4.1 \n99\nThis is a controlled document.

The COP recommends the\nhigher figure as good trade practice and in many cases, lower life-cycle costing.\nGenerally, higher durability than the minimum requirements can be achieved by using materials and methods\noutlined in this COP, with no maintenance of coatings other than washing areas which are not naturally washed by\nrain. Elements more difficult to replace, or to access for maintenance, should be constructed of more durable\nmaterial.\nNormal Maintenance means work recognised as being necessary to achieve the expected durability of a given\nbuilding element.\nAccording to B2/AS1, normal maintenance may include:\nWashing down surfaces subject to wind-driven salt spray and contaminants.\nRe-coating protective surfaces.\nReplacing sealant seals and gaskets in joints.\nAlthough roof or wall cladding can be easily accessed and therefore easily replaced, the same cannot be\nassumed for flashings. Flashings might be embedded in plaster or behind other building elements, making them\nhard to replace without removing cladding or other building features such as windows.\nCladding material may be described as hidden, sheltered or exposed. Some flashings may have sections falling\ninto all these categories, in which case the worst case (sheltered) should prevail in material selection.\nAll metal roof and wall cladding and accessories must be designed and installed to comply with the\ndurability requirements of the NZBC. NZBC requirements relate to performance, however, and do not\nnecessarily relate to aesthetics or cost of replacement. Any pre-painted cladding will change colour over\ntime, and partial replacement would be visible. The roof cladding could have deteriorated, although not\nperforated, within 15 years and still comply with the NZBC, but customer expectations may not be met.\nGood design, correct selection of materials, and good installation and maintenance practices are required to\nachieve optimum product lifespan. \n 4.1 NZBC CLAUSE B2 (EXTRACT)\n 1 \n 4.1 \n101\nThis is a controlled document.

The red rusting of iron and\nsteel is a visible example of corrosion and other examples include the weathering of copper and the\noxidation of aluminium and zinc.\nCorrosion can only happen in the presence of an electrolyte, e.g., water. The occurrence of salt (or other\ncontaminants) in the water increases the conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore greatly increases\nthe reaction rate.\nSalt contamination will also affect the time of wetness. On a clean surface, water vapour will condense\nat 100% relative humidity; on a salt-covered surface, a wet film can be formed at a relative humidity\nlevel of 75% or more.\nCorrosion can also be the result of direct contact with another metal or substance, the result of run-off\nfrom incompatible surfaces or the fall-out of corrosive particles. Time of wetness, presence or lack of\noxygen, and atmospheric contaminants greatly affect the rate of corrosion.\nDifferences in electrical potential on the surface of corroding metal create microscopic cells comprising\ncathodes and anodes. In the case of iron, the positively charged electrons in the anode react with the\nnegatively charged hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte to form iron oxide on the anode. Similar reactions\noccur with other metals. Polarisation changes on the surface cause anodic areas to become cathodic and\nvice versa, so over time, the rate of corrosion is relatively uniform over the surface.\nThe build-up of debris on a cladding surface will promote corrosion. The salts in the debris react with the\ncladding each time they are wetted, and the deposits themselves impede surface drying, increasing the\ntime of wetness.\n 4.2 METAL CORROSION\n 2 \n 4.2 \n102\nThis is a controlled document.

By coating steel with zinc, or a zinc-rich product, the zinc\nbecomes the anode for the steel. The steel then becomes the cathode and does not react with the\nelectrolyte. The process is known as cathodic protection.\nThis protective effect occurs even when there is a small area of steel exposed directly to the electrolyte,\nsuch as a cut sheet edge, drill hole or scratch.\nWhile the zinc reacts in preference to the steel, it does so at a slower rate. In normal environmental\nconditions, the zinc oxide layer that initially forms on the surface of the zinc combines with carbon\ndioxide in the atmosphere to form zinc carbonate. That creates a sealed layer with excellent adhesion,\nand as zinc carbonate has very low solubility, reaction with the electrolyte slows even more.\n4.4.2 \nBarrier Protection \nBarrier protection works primarily by providing a physical barrier between the atmosphere and the steel substrate.\nThe surface of aluminium-dominant coatings is initially very active, but it quickly forms an inert aluminium-oxide\nfilm when exposed to normal atmospheric conditions. Aluminium dominant coatings on steel mainly provide\nbarrier protection as the aluminium, having formed an oxide surface, ceases to offer substantial sacrificial\nprotection.\nThe exposed edges of barrier protected cladding should not be in contact with corrosive surfaces. See 4.9.4\nCompatibility Table\n 4.4 SACRIFICIAL AND BARRIER PROTECTION\n 4.4 \n105\nThis is a controlled document.

Microclimate influences include geothermal fumaroles, rain sheltering, topography and\nground roughness, prolonged wetness, and exclusion of oxygen. Internal microclimates can also\noccur as result of the particular use of the building.\nContaminants and pollutants are corrosive influences which can affect the cladding. These can\ninclude fertiliser, soil, leaf fall-out, exhaust fumes, industrial fumes, bird droppings and the build-\nup of debris. Influences such as chlorides near the sea, geothermal hydrogen sulphide (H S) or\nman-made gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO ) accelerate the corrosion rate by increasing the\nconductivity of the electrolyte and changing its pH value.\nRain provides the moisture that acts as the electrolyte in corrosion cells. Rain varies in pH because\nit picks up various contaminants from the pollutants in the atmosphere. Acid rain can happen in\ngeothermal areas due to the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the atmosphere.\nAt 0 deg C metal corrosion is minimal, because colder temperatures slow the reaction. The corrosion\nrate of some metals doubles with every 10 deg C rise in temperature given the same time of wetness and\nenvironmental conditions. However, in dry, warm environments the time of wetness is decreased by\nfaster drying times, which has the opposite effect.\nDesigners should be aware of macro- and microclimates and the degree of contamination. They should\ndesign their building and select materials considering a combination of all these factors.\n4.5.2 \nSea Spray \nThe major contributor to metal corrosion in New Zealand is sea spray. Seaspray contains a mixture of salts\nconsisting of 2.5 to 4% sodium chloride and small quantities of magnesium, calcium and potassium chloride.\nThese salts make water far more electrically conductive and, therefore, will cause more corrosion.\nSeaspray, evaporation, and infrequent rain increase salt concentrations on exterior surfaces, particularly when it\naccumulates in unwashed areas.\n2\n2\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n106\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.5.2A Airborne Salt from Sea Spray.\nOnshore winds, big swells, wide generation zones and rugged coastline make ideal conditions for the production of\nsalt aerosol.\nThe distance airborne salt is carried inland varies significantly with local wind patterns. Salt deposits have been\nmeasured as far inland as Lake Taupo in the North Island. Geographic or man-made obstructions, such as trees\nor buildings, slow air velocity and allow the air to discharge some of its salt burden, which can make the\nenvironment less aggressive. Conversely, where there are few impediments to the free flow of air, severe marine\ninfluence can extend well inland.\nIn high humidity levels, or when wetted by condensation, marine salts absorb water and form a chloride solution.\nTherefore, the effect of salt spray is greatest in unwashed areas, where salts can accumulate over time.\nWhere the ends of roof cladding are exposed to contaminants such as sea salt or industrial pollutants, it is good\npractice to provide an over-flashing which discharges into the gutter or spouting. (See 8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves\nFlashing Option 1.)\nIt gives a measure of protection to the underside of the roof cladding and the underlay.\nIt provides support for the roofing underlay which is subject to damage from wind and UV.\nWhen using PVC spouting, there is a gap between the spouting and the fascia caused by the thickness of the\nbrackets. In coastal locations where the ends of roof cladding are exposed, this unwashed area becomes\nsusceptible to corrosion. A gutter apron can minimise this risk.\nIf there is no spouting or it has a low front.\nIn severe environments, wind can drive contaminants up the ribs of exposed ends of roof cladding. Metal\nscriber flashings or filler blocks can be used to prevent or inhibit ventilation.\nThe over-flashing should extend 50 mm into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the\nflashing. If there is no over-flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a minimum of\n20 mm.\nIn some cases, the over-flashing becomes a sacrificial flashing which can extend the life of the cladding. In such\ncircumstances, the COP recommends making the flashing from aluminium.\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n107\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.6 \nEnvironmental Categories \nSuppliers of pre-painted metal offer alternative products for different environments, using different\nmetallic coatings, paint systems, paint thickness and metals. The designer or the roof cladding contractor\nshould carefully assess and evaluate these options to comply with the NZBC.\nThe boundaries of different corrosion zones are difficult to define because many factors determine the\ncorrosivity of a particular location. The designer should choose the appropriate materials for the location.\nThe chosen materials should meet the minimum durability requirements of the NZBC and satisfy\ncustomer expectations.\n4.6.1 \nAssessment of Marine Environments \nWind is responsible for the salinity present in marine atmospheres. The wind picks up particles of salt\nfrom breaking waves and can carry them inland. The quantity of salt aerosol entrained by the wind is\naffected by many factors, such as wind strength, wave height, the width of the generation zone, and the\ncontours of the seabed and coastline. These factors along with the persistence of the wind from a given\nquarter determine the corrosivity of a shoreline.\nWhile salt deposits are measurably present in inland areas such as Taupo, the main effect of marine\natmospheres reaches just a few hundred metres from the shore. Particles of salt in the air deposit on\nadjacent surfaces through gravity and contact; the rate at which deposits settle is affected by the\nroughness of the ground that the salt-laden air passes over. Obstacles such as trees slow the wind down,\nincreasing the rate of gravitational deposit, and bringing the salt aerosol in more contact with surfaces\non which they can deposit.\nOn the other hand, open flat land and natural \"wind tunnels\" can allow quite high concentrations of salt\nto travel several hundred metres inland.\nA site's location, relative to the sea or marine inlets, is a common method used to assess the corrosivity\nof a location. The distance from salt water for a given Zone varies with the location, depending on the\nprevailing winds and roughness of water in those areas, as well as the evenness of the terrain it passes\nover.\nWhere environmental Zones overlap, a site-specific evaluation may help define the category into which\nit best fits. Visual evidence of corrosion on adjacent metal surfaces may be present, ground roughness\ncan be assessed, industrial influences can be evaluated and data about the persistence of onshore\nwinds can be obtained from NIWA.\nMore local factors that affect the corrosivity of a specific location include:\nOverhanging shade increases the time of wetness of a structure and corrosion rate.\nHigh levels of water roughness such as caused by strong tidal flow against the wind direction, as is\noften experienced in areas such as Cook Strait, increases salt spray.\nSurfaces not receiving regular and effective rain washing or sufficient manual washing may\nexperience corrosion rates two to three times that of cleaned surfaces.\n 4.6 ENVIRONMENTAL CATEGORIES\n 6 \n 4.6 \n108\nThis is a controlled document.

The most\ncommonly accepted method as outlined in ISO 9223 is measuring first-year corrosion rate of different\nmetals: mild steel (MS), zinc, aluminium and copper. The COP uses the first-year corrosion rate of mild\nsteel as the most relevant and reliable indicator of a location's corrosivity.\nThe names given by different Standards for specified corrosion zones vary. The Corrosion Zones in the\nCode of Practice are similar to those published in NZS 3604:2011 except that:\nthe COP makes a distinction between Harbours, West Coast, and East Coast shorelines, and\nNZS 3604 Zone D (High) is further broken down into E (Very High) and F (Extreme Marine) because, in\nNZS 3604 Zone D, the first-year mild steel corrosion rate can vary from 200 g/m to 1000 g/m .\n4.6.1A Corrosion Zone Categorisation and First year Mild Steel Corrosion Rate\n(g/m)\nNZS3604 Code of\nPractice\nDescription\nMS\nCorrosion\nRate\n(g/m)\nB\nA (Mild)\nFar inland, with no industrial pollution or thermal activity, or\ndry internal.

These include:\ncovered swimming pools;\nfertiliser works;\nmeat works;\nanimal sheds or shelters;\npulp and paper manufacturing; and\nvehicle exhaust fumes.\n4.7.4 \nFossil Fuel Residue \nSulphur dioxide develops when burning fossil fuels. After oxidation and reaction with water it forms sulphuric acid\n(H SO ) that can contribute considerably to the atmospheric corrosion of zinc and steel.\nBurning resinous woods, CCA-treated timber, low-grade coal or oils with a high sulphur content can increase the\nfall-out deposit or condensate from flue gas.\nExhaust fans can cause similar problems when corrosive gases are not filtered at their source.\n2\n 4.7 SPECIAL CLIMATES\n 7 \n 4.7 \n115\nThis is a controlled document.

Paint formulations that are successful overseas have\nsometimes been found lacking colour fastness in the Australasian environment. Proprietary pre-painted cladding\nproducts should give durability protection and keep its appearance for at least 15 years, and at the end of that\nperiod still have the anti-corrosive primers intact and present a good substrate for over-painting.\nThe performance of all paint coatings, however, can be affected by avoidable outside influences.\n4.8.1 \nTouch-up Paint \nColour match paint is sold in pre-colour matching accessories, such as soft edging or brackets, to match the pre-\npainted cladding. It should only be pre-applied before installation and should not be used to repair minor\nscratches and blemishes. These paints may closely match the pre-painted surface initially, but being an air drying\nacrylic, it is likely to weather differently to the pre-applied coating and cause unsightly blotches.\n4.8.1A Touch-up Paint Weathering\n4.8.2 \nSunscreen Lotions \nSun screen lotions containing semi conducting metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, will cause\ndiscoloration of painted surfaces over time. There is no cure for such damage so contact of such chemicals with\npre-painted cladding must be avoided.\n 4.8 PAINT DURABILITY\n 8 \n 4.8 \n116\nThis is a controlled document.

It is\ngenerally difficult to remove graffiti without compromising an existing organic finish; the normal remedy is to\noverpaint as soon as possible. On a weathered pre-painted finish this can generally be achieved by washing and\nrinsing the surface to remove dirt and other contaminants, then applying two coats of acrylic paint.\nIt should be noted that such overpaint cannot, over time, be expected to match the appearance of existing pre-\napplied finishes.\n4.8.4 \nLichen \nWarm temperatures, dust, and rainfall can create an environment for lichens to flourish. Over time the root\nstructures of lichen may infiltrate a painted surface and cause permanent damage.\n 4.8 PAINT DURABILITY\n 8 \n 4.8 \n117\nThis is a controlled document.

They are fed by nutrients in the\natmosphere and tend to occur more commonly in moist and unpolluted environments. Where lichen growth is\npresent, it should be removed. See 16 Maintenance .\nPhysical removal is difficult to achieve completely, and recolonisation is usually rapid. Chemical treatment is\nrecommended.

When a noble metal dissolves in water and flows over a less noble one, the\nmore noble metal deposits on the less noble metal and create corrosion conditions.\n4.9.1A Galvanic Series\nGalvanic Series\nMagnesium\nActive (Anode)\nZinc\nGalvanised Steel\nAluminium\nMild Steel\nCast Iron\nLead\nBrass\nCopper\nBronze\nMonel\nNickel (passive)\nStainless Steel 304 (passive)\nStainless Steel 316 (passive)\nSilver\nTitanium\nGold\nGraphite\nPlatinum\nNoble (Cathode)\nThe similarity of metals is indicated by their relative position in the galvanic series.

Long-term corrosion resistance depends on the separation remaining effective.\nExamples of separation materials are inert plastic tapes, polythene or silicone sealant, and in the case of\nfasteners an EPDM sealing washer.\nWhere gutters and spouting are made from materials incompatible with the roof cladding, there can be\ncontamination from immersion of the sheet ends if the gutter is poorly drained. Special provisions, such as\nensuring there is a 10 mm drainage gap between spouting and fascia should be made to avoid immersion of\ncoated steel roofing into copper gutters. Discharging the gutter into a rain head with a leaf deflector can also\nhelp. Low front spouting can be considered, but that creates aesthetic issues and may contribute to early\ncorrosion in marine areas. No part of copper gutters should be in contact with coated steel roofing or flashings.\n4.9.2 \nThe Electrochemical or Galvanic Series \nThe electrochemical tables or galvanic series scales, often quoted in technical literature as a measure of\ncorrosion, show the electro-potential between pure metals, not between their oxides, carbonates or chlorides.\n 4.9 COMPATIBILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n122\nThis is a controlled document.

Under certain conditions, some metals react with the environment or\nchemicals to form a passive surface, which renders them less active, so that any ranking can be misleading.\n\"Passivity\" becomes an important phenomenon in controlling corrosion rates.\nHowever, the Electrochemical series table is still a useful indicator of electrode potential. The further apart two\nmetals are in the electrochemical series, the greater the potential difference between them.\nMetals termed anodic, active, negative, or less noble corrode in preference to metals that are deemed more\ncathodic, noble, positive or less active. The less noble metal becomes the anode and is subject to corrosion. The\ngreater the potential difference, the more corrosion there will be of the less noble metal; i.e., on the anode.\nThe difference in nobility is why zinc can protect a steel substrate.\nDifferent electrolytes can lead to different rankings, and metal alloys may display more than one potential than\nthat which applies to their \"active\" state.\nThe exposed surface ratio of anode and cathode determines the rate of dissimilar metal corrosion. For instance,\nif a fastener which has a small surface compared to the cladding becomes the anode, its current density will be\nhigh, and the fastener will corrode quickly; e.g., an aluminium rivet in a copper sheet. When the opposite is the\ncase, the effect is not so great.\nThe 4.9.2A Electrochemical table shows zinc is more active than steel.

When\ncondensation, dew or humidity moistens these particles, they react with metal cladding. The reaction is often\nnoticeable as a white zinc corrosion effect, which will precede more serious corrosion.\nAn unwashed or sheltered area is any surface that is above or inside a line drawn at 45 deg to any weathertight\noverhang. Such areas require special consideration, particularly in severe environments.\nUnwashed areas include: unlined soffits, roof overhangs, canopies, sheltered walls, and the upper part of garage\ndoors.\nWall claddings receive less effective rain washing than roofs, and may be harder to maintain or replace, so\nmaterials for wall cladding should be selected accordingly.\n4.10.1A Unwashed Soffits\nUnwashed soffits \ncomprising areas of main \nroof are best avoided\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n128\nThis is a controlled document.

Birds can\nalso deposit other injurious material, eg, fish frames and chicken bones.\n4.10.3 \nSolar Collectors and Other Roof Mounted Structures \nSolar energy collectors, Heating Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may be attached directly to the\nsurface of profiled metal roof cladding or mounted on a frame above the roof plane.\nFor direct fastened solar energy collectors, a complete seal between the photovoltaic (PV) cells and the cladding\nis essential to prevent water ingress resulting in wet storage corrosion.\nRail-mounted systems for solar energy collectors can be installed in a similar manner to HVAC systems and\nother roof-mounted structures. Units may be laid parallel to the roof or oriented at an angle for greater efficiency\nand easier roof maintenance.\nSupport frames installed above the roof must have sufficient gap underneath\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n130\nThis is a controlled document.

A greater\nclearance may be required for larger installations or where greater debris deposits are expected.\nThe support structure may be connected to the rib of clip-fixed products, or supported by the rib and attached\nthrough the profile to the purlins. The designer must ensure that the design of the roof and the structure is\nadequate to resist any additional wind and gravity loads associated with the panels.\nAccess to the roof for inspection and maintenance must be considered when designing roof-mounted structures.\nThe roof cladding should be designed to resist regular roof traffic, or the installation of walkways is\nrecommended.\nWires and conduits penetrating the cladding must be fitted with a gooseneck or proprietary cover to prevent\nreliance on sealant for weatherproofness and must be installed so that their base does not impede water flow.\n4.10.3A Clamp Style Fixing Bracket\n4.10.3B Purlin Fixing Bracket\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n131\nThis is a controlled document.

Typical proprietary support structures are\nmanufactured from aluminium with stainless steel fasteners. Contact between the stainless fasteners and the\nroof cladding should be avoided, but run-off is acceptable.

The copper pipes of solar panels, air-conditioning or other ancillary\nequipment must be sealed to avoid runoff onto any metal cladding or gutters other than copper.\n4.10.5 \nWalkways \nOnly aluminium, stainless steel, inert plastic, or hot-dipped galvanized steel framing members are\nacceptable for support structures above steel cladding and must be supported by the structural\nmembers or across the ribs of the profile adjacent to the ribs. They should be designed to allow natural\nrain washing of the roof underneath.\n4.10.6 \nCapillary Action \nWhile capillary action is both a durability and a weather-tightness issue, it is considered here because it affects\ndurability more often than water tightness, although the two are interrelated.\nCapillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow into narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition\nto, external forces such as gravity. It is caused by the combination of intermolecular forces of surface tension in\nthe water and adhesive forces between the liquid and surrounding surfaces.\nCapillary action can be seen when liquid is drawn up between the bristles of a paintbrush, in absorbent materials\nsuch as blotting paper or a sponge, in a burning candle, a fountain pen, or in the cells of a tree. The effect can\noccur in a tube, but also between two closely spaced mating surfaces.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n133\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.10.6A Capillary Action\nGravity will affect the degree of capillary action; a low sloping pair of surfaces will attract liquid more by capillary\naction than a vertical surface, and a narrow tube will draw a liquid column higher than a wider tube.\nCapillary action is an important consideration in cladding installation and design, and can be considered\nin four main areas:\n1. Closely stacked sheets of trapezoidal or corrugate profiles, or flat sheet that has the sheet ends\nexposed to rain, will draw water between the surfaces which can infiltrate a long way into the stack of\nmaterial. After a short time in the absence of air, it can form volatile corrosive products which are\nunsightly and detrimental to product life.\nWhile metallic coatings have temporary surface protection against wet storage stain and organic\ncoatings also give some protection, there is no hard and fast rule as to how long this will last; it is up\nto the roofing contractor to take appropriate measures. Packs of close stacked sheets exposed to\nwater must be fillet or cross stacked to allow natural air movement and drying, before the onset of\nwet storage stain.\n2. Capillary action can take place in the side lap of roofing sheets, or between a longitudinal flashing and\nthe adjacent rib. For this reason, side laps should be designed with a capillary break, and when\ncalculating the water carrying capacity of a profile, the allowable water depth is taken as being to the\nbottom of the capillary bead, not the rib height. \nEven corrugate profiles are designed to have an asymmetrical shape between under and over crest.\nHowever, this is not normally as effective as the capillary break on a rib profile. This is one of the\nreasons why the minimum pitch for standard corrugate is 8 deg , although it has been proven to perform\nat lower pitches in short runs if the dimension of the overlap is not too generous and it is not\nextending into the water table.\nWith longitudinal flashings, such as barges, the downturn into the pan should not be tight against the\nrib, but have a gap to avoid capillary action from occurring.\n3. Capillary action is also common between the end laps of sheets. When short-run sheets were the\nnorm and end laps were common, the onset of corrosion normally occurred around the lap, despite\nprimer being applied to the surfaces. It was most often concentrated on the upper end of the lap and\nwas caused not by rainwater but by condensation on the underside of the sheet entering the lap.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n134\nThis is a controlled document.

End laps on roofing should be avoided where possible. Where they do occur, end laps must be sealed\nat both ends to avoid ingress of moisture from both internal condensation and external rainfall, and\nend laps in vertical sheets must be sealed at the top end of the lap.\n4.10.6B Roofing Sheet End Lap\nSilicon sealant or lap \ntape at both ends of \nthe lap\n5. The adhesive nature of water that causes capillary action can help drive water up the underside of\nthe sheets at the eaves, rather than discharging into the gutter. Therefore, the ends of all sheets laid\nto a fall less than 8 deg require a drip edge; and the minimum roof pitch of standard corrugate is 8 deg , as it\nis difficult to form a drip edge in that profile.The lower edge of all roofing sheets and flashings laid to a\nfall of less than 8 deg must be drip formed into the gutter to prevent capillary action. \n4.10.7 \nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain \nRoofing materials exposed to the air react with the atmosphere to form a relatively stable surface. Exposing\nmetals to water in the absence air causes the formation of unstable surface films.\nCrevice corrosion occurs in crevices and confined spaces. Crevices are often created because of overlapping\nflashing or sheets of cladding, or between the sheets of close stacked materials.\nDesign details that trap moisture, dirt, and debris should be avoided.\nCorrosion can appear even with a chemically neutral electrolyte. An example of this type of corrosion is the\ncorrosion on metals underneath paint coatings and \"white rust\" - the wet storage stain on closely nested zinc\ncoated roofing sheets. Other metals, such as aluminium/zinc coated and non-ferrous metals, can suffer similar\ndamage.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n135\nThis is a controlled document.

On metallic-coated steel sheets, the passivation\ncoating gives some temporary protection against this process, as do organic coatings, but longevity cannot be\nguaranteed for the duration of this protection. On non-ferrous, metals, wet storage stain can commence very\nrapidly.\nWet packs of sheets should be separated to allow surfaces to dry before substantial storage.\nIf wet storage stain appears on unpainted surfaces, the degree of erosion of the metallic surface may be slight\ndespite the bulky appearance of the deposits. However, when left unchecked it, can quite quickly lead to\nsubstantial degradation. If required, measurements can be taken of the thickness of the material or the metallic\ncoating to determine the extent of erosion.\nEven if the damage is superficial, the white deposits must be removed to allow exposure to the air to allow the\nnormal formation of stable surface films. Use a stiff bristle brush; wire brushes are not recommended as they\nwill remove more of the protective coating.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n137\nThis is a controlled document.

They may\nachieve this objective, but instead they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the eaves line of\nthe roof.\nThat can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly increased time of wetness, and\nprevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\nThe COP recommends against the installation of such products. Alternative solutions include fitting a durable\nspouting material such as copper, installing rain heads with a leaf trap, or installing a proprietary leaf-proof\nspouting system.\nA printable bulletin concerning proprietary leaf guards is available\nat: BGLG01 Using Propietary Leaf Guards.\nExtract:\n\"Leaf guards are widely marketed as a way to prevent the build-up of vegetable matter in spouting.\nThey may achieve this objective, but they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the\neaves line of the roof which can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly\nincreased time of wetness, and prevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\"\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n139\nThis is a controlled document.

This is known as 'drip-spot corrosion' or inert catchment corrosion.\n4.11A Localised Damage due to Inert Catchment\nWater sitting on a surface absorbs carbon dioxide, forming carbonic acid, which is reactive with zinc. On a\ngalvanised surface, the carbonic acid reacts with the zinc and becomes neutral. On an inert surface discharging\ninto an unprotected zinc surface, the carbonic acid is not neutralised, and the reaction will be concentrated on the\ndrip points of the inert surface onto the zinc surface.\nAs the formation of carbonic acid takes time to occur, inert catchment corrosion is normally seen at specific drip\npoints of dew off a roof, rather than below rain-washed painted walls and windows.\n 4.11 INERT CATCHMENT\n 11 \n 4.11 \n143\nThis is a controlled document.

Possible causes include lack of fall, poor\npenetration design, and damage to sheet ribs due to excessive spans or foot traffic. The accumulated water\nincreases the time of wetness and can lead to poultice corrosion.\nAll paint systems on factory pre-painted materials are permeable to a degree and will delay, but not prevent, the\ncorrosive effects of ponding.\nPonding can occur in gutters and spouting when joints or outlets are higher than the sole of the gutter, or when\ndebris accumulates.\nTo help prevent ponding, the minimum pitch for all metal roof cladding in New Zealand is set at 3 deg . At pitches of\nlesser pitches deflection of the structural members or settlement of the building can compromise drainage.\nLow-pitch roof spans must be sized according to the type and frequency of roof traffic to prevent ponding caused\nby rib damage, and penetration flashings must be free-draining.\n 4.12 PONDING\n 12 \n 4.12 \n145\nThis is a controlled document.

When the break-through occurs in the passive film, the actively corroding pit\nconstitutes the anode and the large passive film surrounding the pit acts as a cathodic surface.\nThe rate of dissolution of the metal is strongly influenced by the ratio between anode and cathode areas,\nconsequently, the \"driving force\" behind the pitting attack can be very strong and deterioration can spread quickly.\n 4.13 PITTING CORROSION\n 13 \n 4.13 \n146\nThis is a controlled document.

These stains\nare often mistaken for early deterioration of the cladding.\nTo some degree, swarf will normally be evident at the completion of any roof cladding job. The acceptability of\nswarf depends on how it got there, whether techniques have been applied to minimize it, and the visual exposure\nof the cladding.\nSwarf created by acceptable means of cutting - i.e., power drills, self-drilling screws and shears - will be either\nloose or lightly adhered to the surface film of painted or unpainted sheets. Most swarf can be removed by daily\nhosing, sweeping, or blowing which should be done at the end of each day and at the completion of the job. \nAvoid blowing loose swarf under adjacent cover flashings.\nAny remaining swarf will not be in contact with the metallic substrate and will not cause deterioration of the roof,\nits effect is aesthetic only. Overly aggressive efforts to remove such swarf is likely to damage the appearance of\nthe cladding without enhancing its durability\nOn highly visible surfaces, a soft rag and plastic spatula can be used to remove more tenacious swarf adhesions\nor a diluted mild household cleaner might work on painted surfaces. Wire brushing, steel wool, or pot scouring\ncloths must not be used as they will damage the organic or metallic coating.\nBulletin available: BSCE01 Cut Edge Treatment:\n4.14A Light Scattered Swarf\nLight, scattered swarf is acceptable in most situations.\n4.14B Excessive Swarf\n 4.14 SWARF STAINING AND CUT EDGE CORROSION\n 14 \n 4.14 \n147\nThis is a controlled document.

The heat may cause it to embed deeply in the organic\nfilm and be in contact with the protective metallic substrate.\n4.14C Friction Cut Edge\nFriction cutting that creates swarf can also cause heat damage to metallic and organic protective surfaces.\nThis can severely affect the substrate; removal is difficult or impossible to achieve without mechanically\ndamaging the decorative and/or protective coatings.\nSwarf is not the only problem that cutting with friction blades can create. Such blades will often produce\nexcessive heat at the cutting edge, which will degrade the organic and metallic coatings.\n 4.14 SWARF STAINING AND CUT EDGE CORROSION\n 14 \n 4.14 \n148\nThis is a controlled document.

Similarly, the\nedges of cladding running parallel to flashings, such as at a window head, should have clearance to avoid\nmechanical damage and allow drainage.\nHaving the lower edges of flashings apart from the surface they cover helps to improve the cut edge durability of\nthe flashing. Kick-out barge details are preferred to bird's beak barge details for the same reason. The size of the\nclearance is not critical, but typically it is more than 5 mm.\nFor vermin flashings, both the clearance and the slope should be minimised to ensure the opening size at crest\nlevel does not exceed 7 mm.\n4.15A Window Head\nUnderlay or \nsynthetic \nwrap\nUnderlay\nTypically 3.5 cm\n20 mm batten\n4.15.1 \nGround Clearance \nClearance is required between the bottom of profiled metal cladding and large flat surfaces.

This\nmay take the form of a 3 to 6 mm gap, an inert self-adhesive tape or a PVC vermin strip.\nInternal environments are also important, ventilation must be adequate for the building use, and absorptive of\ncorrosive substances must not be in prolonged contact with the external or internal face of the cladding or\nstructure.\n4.15.2A Cladding Open to Air\nCladding which is open to air will experience the\nnormal wet/dry cycles for which it is designed.\n4.15.2B Vegetation in Contact with\nCladding\nVegetation or earth in contact with the cladding will\nincrease the time of wetness and may contain corrosive\ncompounds.\n 4.15 CLEARANCES\n 15 \n 4.15 \n152\nThis is a controlled document.

It works by the zinc\nsacrificing preferentially to the steel.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, research looked for metallic coatings which would provide longer life.\nAluminium was tried as a coating material because of its passive surface, but it was not satisfactory on its own.\nHowever, aluminium alloyed with zinc and other metals produced more corrosion-proof products than any metal\non its own. (See 4.4.2 Barrier Protection.)\nWe now have two groups of metallic coatings for steel cladding products - zinc-dominant coatings, which\nprimarily provide sacrificial protection; and aluminium-dominant coatings, which primarily provide a barrier\nprotective coating of aluminium oxide. Coatings containing both aluminium and zinc are now the preferred\ncoating for roof and wall cladding products, although zinc-based coatings continue to predominate for various\nother products.\nThe composition and weights of these coatings are described in detail in AS 1397:2011. The following sections\ndiscuss metallic coatings in the order in which they appear in AS 1397, not their rate of use in the market.\n4.16.1.1.1 \nCoating Thickness \nSteel was zinc-coated for many years by dipping short lengths of flat or profiled sheet metal in a bath of molten\nzinc, and the steel was then hung to cool while the excess zinc coating drained off.\nMore than sixty years ago manufacturers developed a continuous hot dipping method. During the continuous hot\ndipping process, the steel coil is run through a bath of molten metal. The thickness is controlled by blowing off\nthe excess coating with air jets applied to both sides of the strip as it leaves the molten metal bath. \nContinuous hot dipping, as opposed to the batch immersion process, is more cost-effective and allows for\ngreater control of the consistency, thickness, and surface condition of the metallic coating.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n154\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nIt is a similar process to that for continuous paint coating, shown in 4.18.1.1 The Paintline Process, with\npriming, coating, and ovens replaced by the molten metal tank and blow-off section.\nT he atmospheric corrosion performance of a hot-dipped zinc coating is closely proportional to its\nthickness.\nThe thickness of coatings in micrometres (m) can be measured with a non-destructive magnetic induction\nmeter or similar device which can then be converted into grams per square metre (g/m).\n4.16.1.1.1A Coating Thickness\nA= 225 gm/m2\nA\nB\nB = 225 gm/m2\nA+ B = 450 gm/m2\n1m\n1m\nThere is confusion about the method of describing the coating thickness of coil-coated sheet and strip products\nin g/m, compared to products that were hot-dipped after fabrication. The coating thickness of sheet and strip\nrefers to the collective amount of coating on both sides of the sheet, effectively dividing the coating weight by\nhalf. It is invalid to equate the coating weight in g/m of hot-dipped zinc coatings on fabricated products, such as\nnails and screws, with that of metallic coatings on sheet and coil; the coating thickness of the fabricated\nproducts relates to one surface only.\nA micron (m) is one-thousandth of a millimetre.\n4.16.1.2 \nGalvanised Steel \nZinc Coating, commonly called galvanising, is still one of the most common metallic coating processes for steel.\nGalvanising describes various methods of adding a metallic zinc coating to steel to give it cathodic protection;\nalso known as galvanic protection.\nGalvanised steel is classed as a \"Z\"-coating and has a bold crystalline pattern or spangle, a random geometric\npattern that resembles frost on a window.\nThere are many processes for galvanising, but only products dipped or immersed in a bath of molten zinc can be\ncalled hot-dipped galvanised, the process used for the metallic coating of steel roof and wall cladding.\nThe thickness of the coating can be more precisely controlled on a continuous coil galvanising-line than it can be\nwith other methods.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n155\nThis is a controlled document.

The coating weight for products intended for painting is\n275g/m, and it is designated Z275.\nSince the advent of ZM coatings, minimised spangle zinc coated products, typically used for painting, are now\ndesignated with the \"M\" after the weight, e.g., Z275M.\nThe process of zinc coating by electro-plating gives a much thinner protective film and is not considered suitable\nfor painted or unpainted cladding materials exposed to the weather.\n4.16.1.3 \nZA Coatings \nZA coatings are a zinc-aluminium alloy coating consisting of 95 % zinc and 5% aluminium by mass, with the\naddition of lanthanides. It is commonly known as Galfan and is as designated ZA in AS/NZS 1397. As an\nEuropean product it generally conforms to EN 10214..\nZA serves the same purpose as galvanised Z and AZ coatings, but has different corrosion characteristics than\nboth.\nZA coatings are not currently available in NZ or Australia.\n4.16.1.4 \nZM Coatings \nZM coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of zinc and a small amount of magnesium. Steel\nwith a continuously hot-dipped coating of zinc with 5 -13% aluminium and 2 - 4% magnesium is designated in AS\n1397:2011 as ZM. In New Zealand, it is commonly marketed as ZAM.\nThe coating weights are similar to Zinc coatings, with ZM 240 used for products which will later be coil coated\nand ZM 450 for unpainted products.\nUnpainted ZM products have been used for roofing accessory and rainwater cladding applications in New\nZealand, but are more commonly found in factory pre-painted products.\n4.16.1.5 \nAZ Coatings \nAZ coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of aluminium. AZ coating, marketed as\nZincalume steel, is an alloy of zinc and aluminium which is now the most commonly used coating in New\nZealand for protecting steel roof and wall cladding.\nAZ coating is applied in the same way as other coatings, but with a pot temperature at about 140C higher than\ngalvanised coating, and it is rapidly cooled to provide a dual-phase microstructure.\nThe alloy consists of 50 to 60% aluminium, zinc, and a small addition of silicon. In New Zealand, the ratio is\nnominally 55:45. These percentage ratios are by mass; by volume, the percentage ratio changes to approximately\n80% aluminium and 20% zinc. Volume is probably a more realistic measure of its nature.\nThe alloy coating thickness generally used for steel roof and wall cladding is 150 g/m (AZ150). This coating is\napproximately the same thickness (0.04 mm) as Z275 zinc. AZ200 coatings are available as a substrate for\norganic coated products to be used in very severe environments.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n156\nThis is a controlled document.

This finish\nhas a relatively high level of initial reflectivity, which darkens over time.\nA thin acrylic film is applied during manufacture in New Zealand. The acrylic film acts as a roll forming lubricant\nand minimises finger marking and surface discolouration.\n4.16.1.6 \nAM Coatings \nAdding magnesium to an aluminium dominant zinc-aluminium alloy coating improves the cut edge corrosion\nresistance to a similar level as zinc coating, but still confers the improved surface protection and slower erosion\nrate of AZ coatings.\nSteel with a continuously hot-dipped coating of 47 - 57% aluminium and zinc, with the addition of 1 - 3%\nmagnesium by mass is designated in AS 1397:2011 as AM.\n4.16.2 \nStainless Steel \nStainless steel is a durable, corrosion-resistant material used in harsh environments when a non-weathering\nfinish is desired. Chromium forms a tenacious oxide protective film on stainless steel that is transparent and\nself-healing, as it will repair itself on exposure to the atmosphere.\nStainless steels are resistant to most chemicals, but are subject to crevice and pit corrosion (see Wet Storage).\nSome light surface staining known as tea staining may appear, but it is not damaging to the product.\nMost stainless steel roof and wall cladding, flashings and panels in New Zealand are made from the 300 series of\naustenitic non-magnetic stainless steel, which contain chromium, nickel, and manganese, with 304 and 316 being\nthe most common grades.\nGrade 304 stainless steel is an alloy of 18% chromium and 8% nickel that provides high corrosion resistance and\nis known as an all-purpose alloy.\nGrade 316 stainless steel should be specified where tea staining must be avoided. It contains 16% chromium, 10%\nnickel, with 2% molybdenum added, which increases resistance to staining and corrosion.\nGrade 445 ferritic stainless steel is now available in New Zealand, which combines the corrosion resistance of\ngrade 316 with formability approaching that of carbon steel. As the work hardening of 445 is much lower than\nwith austenitic grades, it can be formed in a similar way to carbon steel and is more easily sheared.\nGrade 445 stainless steel contains 22% chromium and 1.2% molybdenum and no nickel. It has lower thermal\nexpansion than other grades, so it is less likely to distort in the heat of the sun. The yield stress and hardness of\n445 is higher than 304 and 316, but the tensile strength and elongation properties are lower.\nT he corrosion resistance grade of 445 is similar to grade 316 in most marine and aggressive industrial\nenvironments.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n157\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common finishes\nfor roof cladding and sheet metal flashings, are those designated as 2B and 2D.\nThe 2B finish is a bright, cold-rolled finish that is highly reflective and 2D is a dull finish that is less reflective. BA\nis a bright reflective surface only suitable for decorative cladding in thicker gauges. Embossed patterns are\navailable that reduce visible distortion and minimise glare and reflection.\nStainless steel should not be cleaned with steel wool, but stainless steel wool or synthetic abrasive pads can be\nused. Cleaning should be done with care as roughening the surface may promote further stains.\nStainless steel fixings should be used with stainless steel sheet to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion. The fastener\ngrade must match the grade of the cladding.\nThere is no well-defined yield point for stainless steels. Fully annealed or standard annealed tempers are used for\nease of forming with 304 and 316 having an approximate yield strength of 290 mPa.\nAustenitic stainless steels require different forming techniques than other metals, and are known to be tougher\nand more difficult to form than carbon steel of the same thickness, e.g.,m when shearing stainless steel the\nequipment capacity should be increased between 30% - 50%. Because of the toughness of the metal, sharp\ncutting edges dull more quickly than when used with carbon steel.\nAlthough stainless steel is not much harder than mild steel, increased power is necessary to form it because of\nits high ultimate strength and its higher work hardening rate. As most forming machines are rated for the heaviest\ngauge steel this capacity should be de-rated by 40%.\nPrecautions should be taken not to contaminate the surface of the metal by inclusions from roll forming or\nfolding equipment. It can appear as rust spots on stainless steel, which is detrimental to performance. Stainless\nsteel coil and sheet can be supplied with a strippable film on both faces to avoid this contamination.\n4.16.3 \nAluminium \nThe aluminium alloys used in New Zealand for roof and wall cladding are included in the 5000 series.\nAluminium 5005 has excellent workability, weldability, and corrosion resistance.\nAluminium 5052 is a higher-strength marine-grade alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion in marine or\nindustrial environments.\nFollowing strain-hardening of aluminium alloys, tempering increases the ductility by low-temperature heating, and\ntheir description regarding hardness relates to the last number, e.g. H12 or H32.\nThe description of tempers given to aluminium alloys can be confusing because the different alloys are strain-\nhardened in different ways. As a result, different alloys with the same hardness description may have significantly\ndifferent yield strengths.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BA01 Required Temper for Aluminium Roof and Wall Cladding.\nExtract:\n\"...Using material of a different grade or hardness may severely affect the performance of\nthe cladding profile.

Zinc roof panels and flashings are\ncommonly 0.7 mm thick, although heavier gauges can be used. Zinc roofs are usually fully supported on sarking.\nThe staining potential of zinc run-off onto other surfaces is less than that of copper and lead. Flat zinc panels\nmust be adequately vented from underneath and are available with a high-build lacquer coating to help prevent\ncorrosion of the under-surface.\nZinc has approximately twice the thermal expansion coefficient as steel, so allowance for expansion must be\nmade accordingly.\nUnder 7 deg C the metal becomes brittle and is difficult to form without fracturing.\nZinc used for roof cladding generally contains small percentages of titanium and copper, which add to the\nproperties of pure zinc.\nZinc is also available in a range of pre-patinated surfaces.\n4.16.5 \n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n159\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nCopper \nCopper is a naturally durable product.\nCopper grades 122, 110, and 102 may be used in construction. Grade 122 is the most commonly used; it has been\ndeoxidized with phosphorus, which makes it weldable. The other grades cannot be welded but can be soldered.\nCopper darkens in reaction to the atmosphere. Near seawater or industrial sources of sulphur-containing gases, a\ngreen patina may develop in time. In different environments, the weathered colour may vary from dark brown to\nalmost black.\nCopper-containing alloys, such as brass and bronze, are available when different colours are requested or for\naccessories requiring greater strength.\nCopper is more malleable than steel sheets, and annealed copper is used for hand folding or where a high degree\nof formability is required. Roll formed roofing, wall cladding, gutters, spouts, and flashings are typically made\nfrom half hard copper. Copper roofs are normally fully supported on sarking.\nCopper must be protected from contamination when being processed with tools that have been used to process\nother metals because the resulting inclusions might cause pit corrosion.\nNeither copper nor run-off from copper should come in contact with less noble metals, as it will cause galvanic\ncorrosion. Avoid installing copper in contact with or receiving run-off from bituminous material or other acidic\nsurfaces, because it prevents the formation of the protective patina, causing discolouration and a shortened\nlifespan.\n4.16.6 \nLead \nHistorically, lead has been a popular choice for roof cladding and flashings, because it is naturally durable and is\neasily shaped using hand tools at ambient temperatures, without the need for softening or annealing.\nLead has an inherent lack of mechanical strength and is laid on solid sarking. It has high thermal movement and,\nover time, there is a risk of distortion and lead sheet cracking. Sheet lead is available in weights from 6 kg/m to\n40 kg/m.\nT he thinner the lead, the shorter the length should be. A maximum length of 1500 mm or less than 1.5 m\nis ideal.\nRun-off from a new lead roof can stain other metals with a white lead carbonate. Application of a proprietary\nproduct or boiled linseed oil and mineral turpentine mixture can avoid that happening.\nA factory applied cured coating that inhibits the contact between lead and oxides with water is available. The lack\nof contact reduces the potential for run-off staining other metals, and of lead entering ground water systems.\nAvoid using lead roofs to collect potable water.\n4.16.7 \nTranslucent Sheeting \nTranslucent sheeting should be manufactured from naturally durable products or have a protective surface film to\navoid ultra-violet degradation. (See Natural light for more information.)\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n160\nThis is a controlled document.

It is protected from UV\nerosion by a surface coating consisting of a gel or laminate. The composite is extruded and set over forming\nmoulds to match specific roofing profiles. \nGRP can often be used as translucent sheeting or it can be supplied with a clear, or opaque gel coat to the\nweather surface to provide a high level of corrosion resistance to aggressive atmospheres, where coated metal\nor even non-ferrous metals may not perform as required.\nExamples of use can be found in extreme environments such as wool scouring plants, fertilizer stores, tanneries,\nacid plants and smelters, abattoirs, compost plants, galvanizing plants, and buildings in harsh geothermal areas.\nWhere an entire roof is clad in GRP, (rather than individual sheets separated by metal sheets as in a typical case\nof translucent sheeting), it affects the trafficability and safety requirements. If a GRP roof is required to be\naccessible, it can be manufactured incorporating woven roving reinforcement into the resin matrix to make it\ntrafficable. Another option would be to install stainless steel safety mesh under the roof cladding, if required.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n161\nThis is a controlled document.

With secret fixed fasteners over a\nbenign internal environment, this is easily achieved.\nThe potential for air-borne salt ingress into the cavity of a tray roof is low; the pan is flat or nearly flat, the ribs are\nnarrow and closed at the ends. The BRANZ publication, Research Now: Roof Ventilation 2, tested the durability of\nmetals inside a vented and unvented ceiling space. Even in this Extreme Marine environment, the corrosion rate\nwas low. Their conclusion was that the installation of ventilation openings to roof cavities should not have a\nnegative effect on the long-term performance of galvanised metal fixtures in these spaces. In the unvented\nspaces, the corrosion rate was even lower.\nCompatibility of materials should also be considered. Aluminium, zinc, and aluminium/zinc alloys are compatible\nin contact. While not normally considered compatible, stainless steel clips have also been proven to be durable,\nand not affect the durability performance of aluminium, zinc, aluminium/zinc alloys, or copper, in a dry internal\nenvironment.\nOver wet and corrosive internal environments, or where the underside of a roof or canopy is exposed to weather\nfrom underneath, both the durability of the clip and compatibility of the roof and cladding material must be\nassessed in accordance with the micro-environment.\nIn all cases, adequate ventilation of the roof or wall is essential to prevent degradation of the cladding and other\nbuilding elements.\n4.17A Allowable Clip Material for Tray and Trough Cladding Over Dry Internal\nEnvironments\nRoof Galvanised,\nZincalume\nPre-painted Steel\nPre-painted aluminium\nZinc\nCopper\nClip Galvanised,\nZincalume,\nPlastic\nGalvanised,\nZincalume,\nStainless steel,\nPlastic\nPainted galvanised,\nstainless steel,\nplastic\nStainless steel,\nPlastic\nstainless steel,\nPlastic\n 4.17 TRAY ROOFING CLIP DURABILITY\n 17 \n 4.17 \n162\nThis is a controlled document.

In pre-painted steel coil this is applied continuously as a two-part primer/topcoat system, prior to the\nmaterial being roll formed into profile.\nThe different combinations of metallic coating/primer/topcoat all have different characteristics and must be\nmatched to the material and the environment in which they are to be exposed.\nThe primer and the topcoat have different performance requirements to fulfil.\n4.18.1.1 \nThe Paintline Process \n4.18.1.1A The Paintline Process\n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n163\nThis is a controlled document.

Primers used on coated steel coil have anti-corrosive pigments which inhibits corrosion through an\nelectro-chemical reaction.\n4.18.1.3 \nTop Coat and Backer \nThis is the outer skin and it must give the desired appearance. In terms of durability, it provides a measure of\nbarrier coating while still being breathable, and prevents UV degradation of the primer.\nFunctionally the top coat must be hard enough to prevent excessive marring during profiling and installation; and\nwhen in use, it must:\nbe flexible enough to form to relatively tight bends without excessive micro-cracking;\nbe resistant to fade in NZ's harsh environment;\nwithstand extremes of temperature; and\nbe a suitable surface for the collection of potable water.\nMore recent innovations include solar reflectance technology to minimise the amount of solar heat gain gathered\nby the cladding\nBacker coats generally have the same primer and a thinner top coat than the upper surface. Double-sided systems\ncan be specified for areas where the underside is seen, but in external environments these will be exposed to salt\nspray and other contaminants, and it cannot be assumed that the underside will last as long as the rain washed\ntop surface - even with regular maintenance.\nAs paint formulations from different suppliers may have different performance characteristics, it is important that\ncladding and accessories are supplied from the same manufacturer as differing weathering characteristics may\nresult in visible variance in appearance.\nSurface coating must comply with AS/NZS 2728. Cladding and flashings must come from the same source and\nhave the same coating specification, so that fade rates are similar. Fade rates must not exceed those stipulated\nin AS/NZS 2728. All coatings must be lead free and suitable for the collection of drinking water.\nAS/NZS 2728 has been deemed ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as allowing accelerated testing to\ndetermine colour fastness and durability. Such tests have been found to be an unreliable indication of a system's\nperformance in real-life situations. MRM has therefore adopted an interpretation of this standard as the\ncompliance standard for its members. In the MRM standard, the four-year real-life testing for durability and colour\nfastness are clarified as being Normative (Compulsory).\n4.18.2 \nPost-Painted Factory Applied finish \nThis coating system is most commonly used for pressed metal tiles.\nWhere a coating is applied to a Metallic coated steel or Aluminium substrate after the profile of the roofing sheet\nhas been formed is referred to as a Post-Painted Factory Applied Finish. The metallic substrate may have a coil-\ncoated primer, coil-coated anti-fingerprint coating, a factory-applied post-painted primer or be cleaned and treated\n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n164\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nto suit the application of the coatings in a factory environment.\nPost-painted coating applied to the substrate varies from smooth matt or gloss-painted finishes and textured\ngranule finishes bonded to the substrate with high-build coatings. The dry film builds are high compared to pre-\nprimed or coil-coated products and the films seal any micro-cracking of the metallic coating that may have\noccurred in the forming process.\nThe corrosion performance of the post-painted factory-applied finished products is influenced by the substrate.\nThe use of Aluminium Zinc metallic coating (AZ) has been proven to work extremely well with post-painted\nfinishes in almost all environments.\nThe coatings are durable with expected first-time recoating maintenance of over 15 years. Touch-up of these\ncoatings is possible as the same coating formulation can be applied in the field. As with any organic coating,\nthere will be a gradual breakdown of the resin systems which may result in chalking of the surface.\nChalking is the result of erosion of the surface coating and slight colour changes may occur as the surface resin\nis eroded. The extent of change depends on the pigments used and also the gloss level, a coating that started as\na matt finish will change very little while a gloss finish will appear to have changed more.\nGranule-textured finishes are created using crushed rock, comprising either natural rock or natural rock coated\nwith a ceramic finish containing light-fast inorganic pigments. Both the natural rock and ceramic-coated granules\nprovide exceptional long-term colour durability. The coatings used to adhere the granules to the substrate are\ndesigned to be flexible in all environments and, although durable, the coating is protected from UV by the UV\nopaque granules.\nA clear coating is applied to the granules during the coating process, which helps bond the granules into the\nadhesive base coating and provides a robust surface reducing any damage during the transportation and\ninstallation process. As this clear coat weathers, it exposes the natural or coated surface of the granules, which\nis slightly duller than the initial finish.\n4.18.3 \nPowder Coating \nPowder coating is generally used to colour match accessories used with pre-painted steel cladding and rainwater\ngoods. The use of powder coating on metallic coated steel roof and wall cladding and flashings is not\nrecommended for the following reasons.\nIt will fade at a noticeably different rate to adjacent pre-painted metal surfaces.\nPowder coated products are length limited by the size of the curing oven and cannot be re-formed after\ncoating.\nDrilling or cutting of the sheet after powder coating will create an exposed edge vulnerable to under-cut\ncorrosion.\nStandard powder coating does not have the corrosion resistance of pre-painted metal and is vulnerable to post\ncoating damage and edge creep corrosion.\nIt is difficult to obtain adhesion to powder coated surfaces when overpainting, and the remaining powder coat\nsurface may not provide a good substrate for such.\nPower coating may be used to colour match accessories but cannot be relied upon to increase durability, unless\nspecific pre-treatment and powder coating systems are specified and applied.\n4.18.4 \n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n165\nThis is a controlled document.

Side laps on profiled sheets do not require priming as they are\ndesigned with capillary grooves to drain naturally, or other means to avoid the accumulation of condensation or\nrainwater.\n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n166\nThis is a controlled document.

All exposed fasteners must have a minimum durability of Class 4. (See\n17 Testing and MRM Standards)\nOnly aluminium or stainless steel screws and washers should be used on pre-painted aluminium roof and wall\ncladding. Stainless steel fasteners must not be allowed to come into contact with the cladding and should be\ninstalled through oversize holes.\nSealing washers must be non-conductive to prevent electrical contact between the screw, the metal washer and\nthe cladding surface.\nSteel cladding screws can be subject to hydrogen embrittlement when they are hot dipped galvanised. Alternative\nmethods of galvanising, such as peen plating and other metallic coatings, are generally used in combination with\nan organic coating.\nCare should be taken to minimise damage to the head of the nail or screw when using colour matched painted\nhot-dipped galvanised nails, bolts and screws.\nSandblasting in exposed conditions can significantly reduce the coating thickness and the longevity of the\nfastener.\nPremature failure can result when the shanks of the screws and the eaves purlin are exposed to sea spray, and a\nhigh-fronted gutter is recommended to help prevent this.\nThe performance of the shank of the fastener is also affected by internal environments when the contaminant is\ninside the building, e.g., animal shelters, fertiliser works.\n All fasteners should be easily identified by a code stamped on the head to identify the manufacturer and the\ncoating class.\n4.19.2 \nScrew Guns \nTo avoid damage to the coating to the screw-head, drivers should not be of the impact type and should be fitted\nwith a snug fitting driver bit.\n4.19.3 \nSealant \nSealant should be neutral cure silicone or MS polymer.\n4.19.4 \nUnderlay \n 4.19 ACCESSORIES\n 4.19 \n167\nThis is a controlled document.

These alternatives\nshould be used when underlay support is required with aluminium cladding. Ensure that the underlay-support\nfasteners do not come in contact with the underside of the cladding.\nFor buildings with harsh internal environments, stainless steel, or PVC-coated mesh and netting are available. \nPVC-coated mesh may suffer degradation from UV radiation if used externally or when it is exposed to high levels\nof direct or reflected sunlight.\n 4.19 ACCESSORIES\n 4.19 \n168\nThis is a controlled document.

The COP recommends the\nhigher figure as good trade practice and in many cases, lower life-cycle costing.\nGenerally, higher durability than the minimum requirements can be achieved by using materials and methods\noutlined in this COP, with no maintenance of coatings other than washing areas which are not naturally washed by\nrain. Elements more difficult to replace, or to access for maintenance, should be constructed of more durable\nmaterial.\nNormal Maintenance means work recognised as being necessary to achieve the expected durability of a given\nbuilding element.\nAccording to B2/AS1, normal maintenance may include:\nWashing down surfaces subject to wind-driven salt spray and contaminants.\nRe-coating protective surfaces.\nReplacing sealant seals and gaskets in joints.\nAlthough roof or wall cladding can be easily accessed and therefore easily replaced, the same cannot be\nassumed for flashings. Flashings might be embedded in plaster or behind other building elements, making them\nhard to replace without removing cladding or other building features such as windows.\nCladding material may be described as hidden, sheltered or exposed. Some flashings may have sections falling\ninto all these categories, in which case the worst case (sheltered) should prevail in material selection.\nAll metal roof and wall cladding and accessories must be designed and installed to comply with the\ndurability requirements of the NZBC. NZBC requirements relate to performance, however, and do not\nnecessarily relate to aesthetics or cost of replacement. Any pre-painted cladding will change colour over\ntime, and partial replacement would be visible. The roof cladding could have deteriorated, although not\nperforated, within 15 years and still comply with the NZBC, but customer expectations may not be met.\nGood design, correct selection of materials, and good installation and maintenance practices are required to\nachieve optimum product lifespan. \n 4 DURABILITY\n 1 \n 4.1 \n101\nThis is a controlled document.

The COP recommends the\nhigher figure as good trade practice and in many cases, lower life-cycle costing.\nGenerally, higher durability than the minimum requirements can be achieved by using materials and methods\noutlined in this COP, with no maintenance of coatings other than washing areas which are not naturally washed by\nrain. Elements more difficult to replace, or to access for maintenance, should be constructed of more durable\nmaterial.\nNormal Maintenance means work recognised as being necessary to achieve the expected durability of a given\nbuilding element.\nAccording to B2/AS1, normal maintenance may include:\nWashing down surfaces subject to wind-driven salt spray and contaminants.\nRe-coating protective surfaces.\nReplacing sealant seals and gaskets in joints.\nAlthough roof or wall cladding can be easily accessed and therefore easily replaced, the same cannot be\nassumed for flashings. Flashings might be embedded in plaster or behind other building elements, making them\nhard to replace without removing cladding or other building features such as windows.\nCladding material may be described as hidden, sheltered or exposed.

        "content": "4.2 \nMetal Corrosion \nCorrosion is the process by which something erodes because of a chemical reaction.\nMetal corrosion is a reaction of metal with its environment that causes measurable alteration and is\npart of metal's inherent tendency to revert to an original, more stable form. The red rusting of iron and\nsteel is a visible example of corrosion and other examples include the weathering of copper and the\noxidation of aluminium and zinc.\nCorrosion can only happen in the presence of an electrolyte, e.g., water. The occurrence of salt (or other\ncontaminants) in the water increases the conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore greatly increases\nthe reaction rate.\nSalt contamination will also affect the time of wetness. On a clean surface, water vapour will condense\nat 100% relative humidity; on a salt-covered surface, a wet film can be formed at a relative humidity\nlevel of 75% or more.\nCorrosion can also be the result of direct contact with another metal or substance, the result of run-off\nfrom incompatible surfaces or the fall-out of corrosive particles. Time of wetness, presence or lack of\noxygen, and atmospheric contaminants greatly affect the rate of corrosion.\nDifferences in electrical potential on the surface of corroding metal create microscopic cells comprising\ncathodes and anodes. In the case of iron, the positively charged electrons in the anode react with the\nnegatively charged hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte to form iron oxide on the anode. Similar reactions\noccur with other metals. Polarisation changes on the surface cause anodic areas to become cathodic and\nvice versa, so over time, the rate of corrosion is relatively uniform over the surface.\nThe build-up of debris on a cladding surface will promote corrosion. The salts in the debris react with the\ncladding each time they are wetted, and the deposits themselves impede surface drying, increasing the\ntime of wetness.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 2 \n 4.2 \n102\nThis is a controlled document.

        "content": "4.5 \nThe Environment \n4.5.1 \nAtmosphere \nThe durability performance of metal roof and wall cladding depends on the macro- and microclimates,\nairborne contaminants, and the material itself.\nThe macroclimate is the general environmental category where the building is situated.\nThe microclimate relates to the exact location of the building and the design or position on the roof\nor wall. Microclimate influences include geothermal fumaroles, rain sheltering, topography and\nground roughness, prolonged wetness, and exclusion of oxygen. Internal microclimates can also\noccur as result of the particular use of the building.\nContaminants and pollutants are corrosive influences which can affect the cladding. These can\ninclude fertiliser, soil, leaf fall-out, exhaust fumes, industrial fumes, bird droppings and the build-\nup of debris. Influences such as chlorides near the sea, geothermal hydrogen sulphide (H S) or\nman-made gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO ) accelerate the corrosion rate by increasing the\nconductivity of the electrolyte and changing its pH value.\nRain provides the moisture that acts as the electrolyte in corrosion cells. Rain varies in pH because\nit picks up various contaminants from the pollutants in the atmosphere. Acid rain can happen in\ngeothermal areas due to the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the atmosphere.\nAt 0 deg C metal corrosion is minimal, because colder temperatures slow the reaction. The corrosion\nrate of some metals doubles with every 10 deg C rise in temperature given the same time of wetness and\nenvironmental conditions. However, in dry, warm environments the time of wetness is decreased by\nfaster drying times, which has the opposite effect.\nDesigners should be aware of macro- and microclimates and the degree of contamination. They should\ndesign their building and select materials considering a combination of all these factors.\n4.5.2 \nSea Spray \nThe major contributor to metal corrosion in New Zealand is sea spray. Seaspray contains a mixture of salts\nconsisting of 2.5 to 4% sodium chloride and small quantities of magnesium, calcium and potassium chloride.\nThese salts make water far more electrically conductive and, therefore, will cause more corrosion.\nSeaspray, evaporation, and infrequent rain increase salt concentrations on exterior surfaces, particularly when it\naccumulates in unwashed areas.\n2\n2\n 4 DURABILITY\n 5 \n 4.5 \n106\nThis is a controlled document.

Salt deposits have been\nmeasured as far inland as Lake Taupo in the North Island. Geographic or man-made obstructions, such as trees\nor buildings, slow air velocity and allow the air to discharge some of its salt burden, which can make the\nenvironment less aggressive. Conversely, where there are few impediments to the free flow of air, severe marine\ninfluence can extend well inland.\nIn high humidity levels, or when wetted by condensation, marine salts absorb water and form a chloride solution.\nTherefore, the effect of salt spray is greatest in unwashed areas, where salts can accumulate over time.\nWhere the ends of roof cladding are exposed to contaminants such as sea salt or industrial pollutants, it is good\npractice to provide an over-flashing which discharges into the gutter or spouting. (See 8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves\nFlashing Option 1.)\nIt gives a measure of protection to the underside of the roof cladding and the underlay.\nIt provides support for the roofing underlay which is subject to damage from wind and UV.\nWhen using PVC spouting, there is a gap between the spouting and the fascia caused by the thickness of the\nbrackets. In coastal locations where the ends of roof cladding are exposed, this unwashed area becomes\nsusceptible to corrosion. A gutter apron can minimise this risk.\nIf there is no spouting or it has a low front.\nIn severe environments, wind can drive contaminants up the ribs of exposed ends of roof cladding. Metal\nscriber flashings or filler blocks can be used to prevent or inhibit ventilation.\nThe over-flashing should extend 50 mm into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the\nflashing. If there is no over-flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a minimum of\n20 mm.\nIn some cases, the over-flashing becomes a sacrificial flashing which can extend the life of the cladding. In such\ncircumstances, the COP recommends making the flashing from aluminium.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 5 \n 4.5 \n107\nThis is a controlled document.

            "content": "Onshore winds, big swells, wide generation zones and rugged coastline make ideal conditions for the production of\nsalt aerosol.\nThe distance airborne salt is carried inland varies significantly with local wind patterns. Salt deposits have been\nmeasured as far inland as Lake Taupo in the North Island. Geographic or man-made obstructions, such as trees\nor buildings, slow air velocity and allow the air to discharge some of its salt burden, which can make the\nenvironment less aggressive. Conversely, where there are few impediments to the free flow of air, severe marine\ninfluence can extend well inland.\nIn high humidity levels, or when wetted by condensation, marine salts absorb water and form a chloride solution.\nTherefore, the effect of salt spray is greatest in unwashed areas, where salts can accumulate over time.\nWhere the ends of roof cladding are exposed to contaminants such as sea salt or industrial pollutants, it is good\npractice to provide an over-flashing which discharges into the gutter or spouting. (See 8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves\nFlashing Option 1.)\nIt gives a measure of protection to the underside of the roof cladding and the underlay.\nIt provides support for the roofing underlay which is subject to damage from wind and UV.\nWhen using PVC spouting, there is a gap between the spouting and the fascia caused by the thickness of the\nbrackets. In coastal locations where the ends of roof cladding are exposed, this unwashed area becomes\nsusceptible to corrosion. A gutter apron can minimise this risk.\nIf there is no spouting or it has a low front.\nIn severe environments, wind can drive contaminants up the ribs of exposed ends of roof cladding. Metal\nscriber flashings or filler blocks can be used to prevent or inhibit ventilation.\nThe over-flashing should extend 50 mm into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the\nflashing. If there is no over-flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a minimum of\n20 mm.\nIn some cases, the over-flashing becomes a sacrificial flashing which can extend the life of the cladding. In such\ncircumstances, the COP recommends making the flashing from aluminium.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n107\nThis is a controlled document.

The designer or the roof cladding contractor\nshould carefully assess and evaluate these options to comply with the NZBC.\nThe boundaries of different corrosion zones are difficult to define because many factors determine the\ncorrosivity of a particular location. The designer should choose the appropriate materials for the location.\nThe chosen materials should meet the minimum durability requirements of the NZBC and satisfy\ncustomer expectations.\n4.6.1 \nAssessment of Marine Environments \nWind is responsible for the salinity present in marine atmospheres. The wind picks up particles of salt\nfrom breaking waves and can carry them inland. The quantity of salt aerosol entrained by the wind is\naffected by many factors, such as wind strength, wave height, the width of the generation zone, and the\ncontours of the seabed and coastline. These factors along with the persistence of the wind from a given\nquarter determine the corrosivity of a shoreline.\nWhile salt deposits are measurably present in inland areas such as Taupo, the main effect of marine\natmospheres reaches just a few hundred metres from the shore. Particles of salt in the air deposit on\nadjacent surfaces through gravity and contact; the rate at which deposits settle is affected by the\nroughness of the ground that the salt-laden air passes over. Obstacles such as trees slow the wind down,\nincreasing the rate of gravitational deposit, and bringing the salt aerosol in more contact with surfaces\non which they can deposit.\nOn the other hand, open flat land and natural \"wind tunnels\" can allow quite high concentrations of salt\nto travel several hundred metres inland.\nA site's location, relative to the sea or marine inlets, is a common method used to assess the corrosivity\nof a location. The distance from salt water for a given Zone varies with the location, depending on the\nprevailing winds and roughness of water in those areas, as well as the evenness of the terrain it passes\nover.\nWhere environmental Zones overlap, a site-specific evaluation may help define the category into which\nit best fits. Visual evidence of corrosion on adjacent metal surfaces may be present, ground roughness\ncan be assessed, industrial influences can be evaluated and data about the persistence of onshore\nwinds can be obtained from NIWA.\nMore local factors that affect the corrosivity of a specific location include:\nOverhanging shade increases the time of wetness of a structure and corrosion rate.\nHigh levels of water roughness such as caused by strong tidal flow against the wind direction, as is\noften experienced in areas such as Cook Strait, increases salt spray.\nSurfaces not receiving regular and effective rain washing or sufficient manual washing may\nexperience corrosion rates two to three times that of cleaned surfaces.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 6 \n 4.6 \n108\nThis is a controlled document.

The most\ncommonly accepted method as outlined in ISO 9223 is measuring first-year corrosion rate of different\nmetals: mild steel (MS), zinc, aluminium and copper. The COP uses the first-year corrosion rate of mild\nsteel as the most relevant and reliable indicator of a location's corrosivity.\nThe names given by different Standards for specified corrosion zones vary.

The Corrosion Zones in the\nCode of Practice are similar to those published in NZS 3604:2011 except that:\nthe COP makes a distinction between Harbours, West Coast, and East Coast shorelines, and\nNZS 3604 Zone D (High) is further broken down into E (Very High) and F (Extreme Marine) because, in\nNZS 3604 Zone D, the first-year mild steel corrosion rate can vary from 200 g/m to 1000 g/m .\n4.6.1A Corrosion Zone Categorisation and First year Mild Steel Corrosion Rate\n(g/m)\nNZS3604 Code of\nPractice\nDescription\nMS\nCorrosion\nRate\n(g/m)\nB\nA (Mild)\nFar inland, with no industrial pollution or thermal activity, or\ndry internal.

When a noble metal dissolves in water and flows over a less noble one, the\nmore noble metal deposits on the less noble metal and create corrosion conditions.\n4.9.1A Galvanic Series\nGalvanic Series\nMagnesium\nActive (Anode)\nZinc\nGalvanised Steel\nAluminium\nMild Steel\nCast Iron\nLead\nBrass\nCopper\nBronze\nMonel\nNickel (passive)\nStainless Steel 304 (passive)\nStainless Steel 316 (passive)\nSilver\nTitanium\nGold\nGraphite\nPlatinum\nNoble (Cathode)\nThe similarity of metals is indicated by their relative position in the galvanic series.

Long-term corrosion resistance depends on the separation remaining effective.\nExamples of separation materials are inert plastic tapes, polythene or silicone sealant, and in the case of\nfasteners an EPDM sealing washer.\nWhere gutters and spouting are made from materials incompatible with the roof cladding, there can be\ncontamination from immersion of the sheet ends if the gutter is poorly drained. Special provisions, such as\nensuring there is a 10 mm drainage gap between spouting and fascia should be made to avoid immersion of\ncoated steel roofing into copper gutters. Discharging the gutter into a rain head with a leaf deflector can also\nhelp. Low front spouting can be considered, but that creates aesthetic issues and may contribute to early\ncorrosion in marine areas. No part of copper gutters should be in contact with coated steel roofing or flashings.\n4.9.2 \nThe Electrochemical or Galvanic Series \nThe electrochemical tables or galvanic series scales, often quoted in technical literature as a measure of\ncorrosion, show the electro-potential between pure metals, not between their oxides, carbonates or chlorides.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n122\nThis is a controlled document.

Under certain conditions, some metals react with the environment or\nchemicals to form a passive surface, which renders them less active, so that any ranking can be misleading.\n\"Passivity\" becomes an important phenomenon in controlling corrosion rates.\nHowever, the Electrochemical series table is still a useful indicator of electrode potential. The further apart two\nmetals are in the electrochemical series, the greater the potential difference between them.\nMetals termed anodic, active, negative, or less noble corrode in preference to metals that are deemed more\ncathodic, noble, positive or less active. The less noble metal becomes the anode and is subject to corrosion. The\ngreater the potential difference, the more corrosion there will be of the less noble metal; i.e., on the anode.\nThe difference in nobility is why zinc can protect a steel substrate.\nDifferent electrolytes can lead to different rankings, and metal alloys may display more than one potential than\nthat which applies to their \"active\" state.\nThe exposed surface ratio of anode and cathode determines the rate of dissimilar metal corrosion. For instance,\nif a fastener which has a small surface compared to the cladding becomes the anode, its current density will be\nhigh, and the fastener will corrode quickly; e.g., an aluminium rivet in a copper sheet. When the opposite is the\ncase, the effect is not so great.\nThe 4.9.2A Electrochemical table shows zinc is more active than steel. Contact between steel and zinc, in\nthe presence of moisture, will cause the zinc to corrode or sacrifice itself, to protect the steel.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n123\nThis is a controlled document.

Under certain conditions, some metals react with the environment or\nchemicals to form a passive surface, which renders them less active, so that any ranking can be misleading.\n\"Passivity\" becomes an important phenomenon in controlling corrosion rates.\nHowever, the Electrochemical series table is still a useful indicator of electrode potential. The further apart two\nmetals are in the electrochemical series, the greater the potential difference between them.\nMetals termed anodic, active, negative, or less noble corrode in preference to metals that are deemed more\ncathodic, noble, positive or less active. The less noble metal becomes the anode and is subject to corrosion. The\ngreater the potential difference, the more corrosion there will be of the less noble metal; i.e., on the anode.\nThe difference in nobility is why zinc can protect a steel substrate.\nDifferent electrolytes can lead to different rankings, and metal alloys may display more than one potential than\nthat which applies to their \"active\" state.\nThe exposed surface ratio of anode and cathode determines the rate of dissimilar metal corrosion. For instance,\nif a fastener which has a small surface compared to the cladding becomes the anode, its current density will be\nhigh, and the fastener will corrode quickly; e.g., an aluminium rivet in a copper sheet. When the opposite is the\ncase, the effect is not so great.\nThe 4.9.2A Electrochemical table shows zinc is more active than steel. Contact between steel and zinc, in\nthe presence of moisture, will cause the zinc to corrode or sacrifice itself, to protect the steel.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.9 COMPATIBILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n123\nThis is a controlled document.

Birds can\nalso deposit other injurious material, eg, fish frames and chicken bones.\n4.10.3 \nSolar Collectors and Other Roof Mounted Structures \nSolar energy collectors, Heating Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may be attached directly to the\nsurface of profiled metal roof cladding or mounted on a frame above the roof plane.\nFor direct fastened solar energy collectors, a complete seal between the photovoltaic (PV) cells and the cladding\nis essential to prevent water ingress resulting in wet storage corrosion.\nRail-mounted systems for solar energy collectors can be installed in a similar manner to HVAC systems and\nother roof-mounted structures. Units may be laid parallel to the roof or oriented at an angle for greater efficiency\nand easier roof maintenance.\nSupport frames installed above the roof must have sufficient gap underneath\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n130\nThis is a controlled document.

A greater\nclearance may be required for larger installations or where greater debris deposits are expected.\nThe support structure may be connected to the rib of clip-fixed products, or supported by the rib and attached\nthrough the profile to the purlins. The designer must ensure that the design of the roof and the structure is\nadequate to resist any additional wind and gravity loads associated with the panels.\nAccess to the roof for inspection and maintenance must be considered when designing roof-mounted structures.\nThe roof cladding should be designed to resist regular roof traffic, or the installation of walkways is\nrecommended.\nWires and conduits penetrating the cladding must be fitted with a gooseneck or proprietary cover to prevent\nreliance on sealant for weatherproofness and must be installed so that their base does not impede water flow.\n4.10.3A Clamp Style Fixing Bracket\n4.10.3B Purlin Fixing Bracket\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n131\nThis is a controlled document.

Typical proprietary support structures are\nmanufactured from aluminium with stainless steel fasteners. Contact between the stainless fasteners and the\nroof cladding should be avoided, but run-off is acceptable. Contact with, or run-off from, copper onto painted and\nunpainted steel and aluminium roofs must be avoided.\n4.10.4 \n4.10.3C Proprietary Cable Hood\nPVC Cap\nSlotted PVC Pipe\nDektite\nRoofing Screws\nSealant\nBoot Flashing\n4.10.3D Supported HVAC Installation\nA well-designed HVAC installation allows free draining of\nwater, isolates incompatible materials, has little reliance\non sealant and avoids extensive dry-pan back flashings\n4.10.3E Rib Supported Photovoltaic\nBracket\nTypical rib-supported systems are Manufactured from\naluminium.\n4.10.3F Tilted Photovoltaic Installation\nAn example of a proprietary tilted PV Installation.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n132\nThis is a controlled document.

The copper pipes of solar panels, air-conditioning or other ancillary\nequipment must be sealed to avoid runoff onto any metal cladding or gutters other than copper.\n4.10.5 \nWalkways \nOnly aluminium, stainless steel, inert plastic, or hot-dipped galvanized steel framing members are\nacceptable for support structures above steel cladding and must be supported by the structural\nmembers or across the ribs of the profile adjacent to the ribs. They should be designed to allow natural\nrain washing of the roof underneath.\n4.10.6 \nCapillary Action \nWhile capillary action is both a durability and a weather-tightness issue, it is considered here because it affects\ndurability more often than water tightness, although the two are interrelated.\nCapillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow into narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition\nto, external forces such as gravity. It is caused by the combination of intermolecular forces of surface tension in\nthe water and adhesive forces between the liquid and surrounding surfaces.\nCapillary action can be seen when liquid is drawn up between the bristles of a paintbrush, in absorbent materials\nsuch as blotting paper or a sponge, in a burning candle, a fountain pen, or in the cells of a tree. The effect can\noccur in a tube, but also between two closely spaced mating surfaces.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n133\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.10.6A Capillary Action\nGravity will affect the degree of capillary action; a low sloping pair of surfaces will attract liquid more by capillary\naction than a vertical surface, and a narrow tube will draw a liquid column higher than a wider tube.\nCapillary action is an important consideration in cladding installation and design, and can be considered\nin four main areas:\n1. Closely stacked sheets of trapezoidal or corrugate profiles, or flat sheet that has the sheet ends\nexposed to rain, will draw water between the surfaces which can infiltrate a long way into the stack of\nmaterial. After a short time in the absence of air, it can form volatile corrosive products which are\nunsightly and detrimental to product life.\nWhile metallic coatings have temporary surface protection against wet storage stain and organic\ncoatings also give some protection, there is no hard and fast rule as to how long this will last; it is up\nto the roofing contractor to take appropriate measures. Packs of close stacked sheets exposed to\nwater must be fillet or cross stacked to allow natural air movement and drying, before the onset of\nwet storage stain.\n2. Capillary action can take place in the side lap of roofing sheets, or between a longitudinal flashing and\nthe adjacent rib. For this reason, side laps should be designed with a capillary break, and when\ncalculating the water carrying capacity of a profile, the allowable water depth is taken as being to the\nbottom of the capillary bead, not the rib height. \nEven corrugate profiles are designed to have an asymmetrical shape between under and over crest.\nHowever, this is not normally as effective as the capillary break on a rib profile. This is one of the\nreasons why the minimum pitch for standard corrugate is 8 deg , although it has been proven to perform\nat lower pitches in short runs if the dimension of the overlap is not too generous and it is not\nextending into the water table.\nWith longitudinal flashings, such as barges, the downturn into the pan should not be tight against the\nrib, but have a gap to avoid capillary action from occurring.\n3. Capillary action is also common between the end laps of sheets. When short-run sheets were the\nnorm and end laps were common, the onset of corrosion normally occurred around the lap, despite\nprimer being applied to the surfaces. It was most often concentrated on the upper end of the lap and\nwas caused not by rainwater but by condensation on the underside of the sheet entering the lap.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n134\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4. End laps on roofing should be avoided where possible. Where they do occur, end laps must be sealed\nat both ends to avoid ingress of moisture from both internal condensation and external rainfall, and\nend laps in vertical sheets must be sealed at the top end of the lap.\n4.10.6B Roofing Sheet End Lap\nSilicon sealant or lap \ntape at both ends of \nthe lap\n5. The adhesive nature of water that causes capillary action can help drive water up the underside of\nthe sheets at the eaves, rather than discharging into the gutter. Therefore, the ends of all sheets laid\nto a fall less than 8 deg require a drip edge; and the minimum roof pitch of standard corrugate is 8 deg , as it\nis difficult to form a drip edge in that profile.The lower edge of all roofing sheets and flashings laid to a\nfall of less than 8 deg must be drip formed into the gutter to prevent capillary action. \n4.10.7 \nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain \nRoofing materials exposed to the air react with the atmosphere to form a relatively stable surface. Exposing\nmetals to water in the absence air causes the formation of unstable surface films.\nCrevice corrosion occurs in crevices and confined spaces. Crevices are often created because of overlapping\nflashing or sheets of cladding, or between the sheets of close stacked materials.\nDesign details that trap moisture, dirt, and debris should be avoided.\nCorrosion can appear even with a chemically neutral electrolyte. An example of this type of corrosion is the\ncorrosion on metals underneath paint coatings and \"white rust\" - the wet storage stain on closely nested zinc\ncoated roofing sheets. Other metals, such as aluminium/zinc coated and non-ferrous metals, can suffer similar\ndamage.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n135\nThis is a controlled document.

On metallic-coated steel sheets, the passivation\ncoating gives some temporary protection against this process, as do organic coatings, but longevity cannot be\nguaranteed for the duration of this protection. On non-ferrous, metals, wet storage stain can commence very\nrapidly.\nWet packs of sheets should be separated to allow surfaces to dry before substantial storage.\nIf wet storage stain appears on unpainted surfaces, the degree of erosion of the metallic surface may be slight\ndespite the bulky appearance of the deposits. However, when left unchecked it, can quite quickly lead to\nsubstantial degradation. If required, measurements can be taken of the thickness of the material or the metallic\ncoating to determine the extent of erosion.\nEven if the damage is superficial, the white deposits must be removed to allow exposure to the air to allow the\nnormal formation of stable surface films. Use a stiff bristle brush; wire brushes are not recommended as they\nwill remove more of the protective coating.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n137\nThis is a controlled document.

It can lead to premature corrosion failure.\nThe test requirement for paint adhesion in AS/NZS 2728 and by the NZMRM is a bend test over a nominated\nnumber of material thicknesses (T) and it is measured as the internal diameter.\nThe radius required to avoid microcracking on metallic coated and pre-painted steel is measured externally. To\nobtain an external radius, add two material thicknesses to the internal diameter, and divide the result by two.\n4.10.8A Microcracking : a\n(a)\n0 T internal diameter = 1.0 T external radius\n4.10.8B Microcracking : b\n(b)\n(b) 1 T internal diameter = 1.5 T external radius\n4.10.8C Microcracking : c\n(c)\n(c) 2 T internal diameter = 2.0 T external radius\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n138\nThis is a controlled document.

They may\nachieve this objective, but instead they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the eaves line of\nthe roof.\nThat can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly increased time of wetness, and\nprevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\nThe COP recommends against the installation of such products. Alternative solutions include fitting a durable\nspouting material such as copper, installing rain heads with a leaf trap, or installing a proprietary leaf-proof\nspouting system.\nA printable bulletin concerning proprietary leaf guards is available\nat: BGLG01 Using Propietary Leaf Guards.\nExtract:\n\"Leaf guards are widely marketed as a way to prevent the build-up of vegetable matter in spouting.\nThey may achieve this objective, but they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the\neaves line of the roof which can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly\nincreased time of wetness, and prevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\"\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n139\nThis is a controlled document.

            "content": "Gravity will affect the degree of capillary action; a low sloping pair of surfaces will attract liquid more by capillary\naction than a vertical surface, and a narrow tube will draw a liquid column higher than a wider tube.\nCapillary action is an important consideration in cladding installation and design, and can be considered\nin four main areas:\n1. Closely stacked sheets of trapezoidal or corrugate profiles, or flat sheet that has the sheet ends\nexposed to rain, will draw water between the surfaces which can infiltrate a long way into the stack of\nmaterial. After a short time in the absence of air, it can form volatile corrosive products which are\nunsightly and detrimental to product life.\nWhile metallic coatings have temporary surface protection against wet storage stain and organic\ncoatings also give some protection, there is no hard and fast rule as to how long this will last; it is up\nto the roofing contractor to take appropriate measures. Packs of close stacked sheets exposed to\nwater must be fillet or cross stacked to allow natural air movement and drying, before the onset of\nwet storage stain.\n2. Capillary action can take place in the side lap of roofing sheets, or between a longitudinal flashing and\nthe adjacent rib. For this reason, side laps should be designed with a capillary break, and when\ncalculating the water carrying capacity of a profile, the allowable water depth is taken as being to the\nbottom of the capillary bead, not the rib height. \nEven corrugate profiles are designed to have an asymmetrical shape between under and over crest.\nHowever, this is not normally as effective as the capillary break on a rib profile. This is one of the\nreasons why the minimum pitch for standard corrugate is 8 deg , although it has been proven to perform\nat lower pitches in short runs if the dimension of the overlap is not too generous and it is not\nextending into the water table.\nWith longitudinal flashings, such as barges, the downturn into the pan should not be tight against the\nrib, but have a gap to avoid capillary action from occurring.\n3. Capillary action is also common between the end laps of sheets. When short-run sheets were the\nnorm and end laps were common, the onset of corrosion normally occurred around the lap, despite\nprimer being applied to the surfaces. It was most often concentrated on the upper end of the lap and\nwas caused not by rainwater but by condensation on the underside of the sheet entering the lap.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n134\nThis is a controlled document.

On metallic-coated steel sheets, the passivation\ncoating gives some temporary protection against this process, as do organic coatings, but longevity cannot be\nguaranteed for the duration of this protection. On non-ferrous, metals, wet storage stain can commence very\nrapidly.\nWet packs of sheets should be separated to allow surfaces to dry before substantial storage.\nIf wet storage stain appears on unpainted surfaces, the degree of erosion of the metallic surface may be slight\ndespite the bulky appearance of the deposits. However, when left unchecked it, can quite quickly lead to\nsubstantial degradation. If required, measurements can be taken of the thickness of the material or the metallic\ncoating to determine the extent of erosion.\nEven if the damage is superficial, the white deposits must be removed to allow exposure to the air to allow the\nnormal formation of stable surface films.

Possible causes include lack of fall, poor\npenetration design, and damage to sheet ribs due to excessive spans or foot traffic. The accumulated water\nincreases the time of wetness and can lead to poultice corrosion.\nAll paint systems on factory pre-painted materials are permeable to a degree and will delay, but not prevent, the\ncorrosive effects of ponding.\nPonding can occur in gutters and spouting when joints or outlets are higher than the sole of the gutter, or when\ndebris accumulates.\nTo help prevent ponding, the minimum pitch for all metal roof cladding in New Zealand is set at 3 deg . At pitches of\nlesser pitches deflection of the structural members or settlement of the building can compromise drainage.\nLow-pitch roof spans must be sized according to the type and frequency of roof traffic to prevent ponding caused\nby rib damage, and penetration flashings must be free-draining.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 12 \n 4.12 \n145\nThis is a controlled document.

When the break-through occurs in the passive film, the actively corroding pit\nconstitutes the anode and the large passive film surrounding the pit acts as a cathodic surface.\nThe rate of dissolution of the metal is strongly influenced by the ratio between anode and cathode areas,\nconsequently, the \"driving force\" behind the pitting attack can be very strong and deterioration can spread quickly.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 13 \n 4.13 \n146\nThis is a controlled document.

Similarly, the\nedges of cladding running parallel to flashings, such as at a window head, should have clearance to avoid\nmechanical damage and allow drainage.\nHaving the lower edges of flashings apart from the surface they cover helps to improve the cut edge durability of\nthe flashing. Kick-out barge details are preferred to bird's beak barge details for the same reason. The size of the\nclearance is not critical, but typically it is more than 5 mm.\nFor vermin flashings, both the clearance and the slope should be minimised to ensure the opening size at crest\nlevel does not exceed 7 mm.\n4.15A Window Head\nUnderlay or \nsynthetic \nwrap\nUnderlay\nTypically 3.5 cm\n20 mm batten\n4.15.1 \nGround Clearance \nClearance is required between the bottom of profiled metal cladding and large flat surfaces.

        "content": "4.16 \nMaterials \nMetals used in the roof and wall cladding industry in New Zealand are:\nsteel coated with zinc - Galvanised steel;\nsteel coated with an alloy of aluminium and zinc, sometimes with the inclusion of other minority elements;\naluminium;\ncopper;\nzinc;\nstainless steel; and\nlead.\n*Many of these can coated with an organic coating, including acrylic, polyester and PVDF.\n4.16.1 \nSteel \n4.16.1.1 \nMetallic Coatings \nFor most of the nearly 200-year history of lightweight steel cladding, the protective metal coating has been made\nfrom zinc (usually with minor additions of other metals), and this is called galvanised steel. It works by the zinc\nsacrificing preferentially to the steel.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, research looked for metallic coatings which would provide longer life.\nAluminium was tried as a coating material because of its passive surface, but it was not satisfactory on its own.\nHowever, aluminium alloyed with zinc and other metals produced more corrosion-proof products than any metal\non its own. (See 4.4.2 Barrier Protection.)\nWe now have two groups of metallic coatings for steel cladding products - zinc-dominant coatings, which\nprimarily provide sacrificial protection; and aluminium-dominant coatings, which primarily provide a barrier\nprotective coating of aluminium oxide. Coatings containing both aluminium and zinc are now the preferred\ncoating for roof and wall cladding products, although zinc-based coatings continue to predominate for various\nother products.\nThe composition and weights of these coatings are described in detail in AS 1397:2011. The following sections\ndiscuss metallic coatings in the order in which they appear in AS 1397, not their rate of use in the market.\n4.16.1.1.1 \nCoating Thickness \nSteel was zinc-coated for many years by dipping short lengths of flat or profiled sheet metal in a bath of molten\nzinc, and the steel was then hung to cool while the excess zinc coating drained off.\nMore than sixty years ago manufacturers developed a continuous hot dipping method. During the continuous hot\ndipping process, the steel coil is run through a bath of molten metal. The thickness is controlled by blowing off\nthe excess coating with air jets applied to both sides of the strip as it leaves the molten metal bath. \nContinuous hot dipping, as opposed to the batch immersion process, is more cost-effective and allows for\ngreater control of the consistency, thickness, and surface condition of the metallic coating.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n154\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nIt is a similar process to that for continuous paint coating, shown in 4.18.1.1 The Paintline Process, with\npriming, coating, and ovens replaced by the molten metal tank and blow-off section.\nT he atmospheric corrosion performance of a hot-dipped zinc coating is closely proportional to its\nthickness.\nThe thickness of coatings in micrometres (m) can be measured with a non-destructive magnetic induction\nmeter or similar device which can then be converted into grams per square metre (g/m).\n4.16.1.1.1A Coating Thickness\nA= 225 gm/m2\nA\nB\nB = 225 gm/m2\nA+ B = 450 gm/m2\n1m\n1m\nThere is confusion about the method of describing the coating thickness of coil-coated sheet and strip products\nin g/m, compared to products that were hot-dipped after fabrication. The coating thickness of sheet and strip\nrefers to the collective amount of coating on both sides of the sheet, effectively dividing the coating weight by\nhalf. It is invalid to equate the coating weight in g/m of hot-dipped zinc coatings on fabricated products, such as\nnails and screws, with that of metallic coatings on sheet and coil; the coating thickness of the fabricated\nproducts relates to one surface only.\nA micron (m) is one-thousandth of a millimetre.\n4.16.1.2 \nGalvanised Steel \nZinc Coating, commonly called galvanising, is still one of the most common metallic coating processes for steel.\nGalvanising describes various methods of adding a metallic zinc coating to steel to give it cathodic protection;\nalso known as galvanic protection.\nGalvanised steel is classed as a \"Z\"-coating and has a bold crystalline pattern or spangle, a random geometric\npattern that resembles frost on a window.\nThere are many processes for galvanising, but only products dipped or immersed in a bath of molten zinc can be\ncalled hot-dipped galvanised, the process used for the metallic coating of steel roof and wall cladding.\nThe thickness of the coating can be more precisely controlled on a continuous coil galvanising-line than it can be\nwith other methods.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n155\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nThe standard coating weight for unpainted galvanised coil and sheet used for roof and wall cladding is 450 g/m,\ndesignated Z450, but other coating weights are available. The coating weight for products intended for painting is\n275g/m, and it is designated Z275.\nSince the advent of ZM coatings, minimised spangle zinc coated products, typically used for painting, are now\ndesignated with the \"M\" after the weight, e.g., Z275M.\nThe process of zinc coating by electro-plating gives a much thinner protective film and is not considered suitable\nfor painted or unpainted cladding materials exposed to the weather.\n4.16.1.3 \nZA Coatings \nZA coatings are a zinc-aluminium alloy coating consisting of 95 % zinc and 5% aluminium by mass, with the\naddition of lanthanides. It is commonly known as Galfan and is as designated ZA in AS/NZS 1397. As an\nEuropean product it generally conforms to EN 10214..\nZA serves the same purpose as galvanised Z and AZ coatings, but has different corrosion characteristics than\nboth.\nZA coatings are not currently available in NZ or Australia.\n4.16.1.4 \nZM Coatings \nZM coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of zinc and a small amount of magnesium. Steel\nwith a continuously hot-dipped coating of zinc with 5 -13% aluminium and 2 - 4% magnesium is designated in AS\n1397:2011 as ZM. In New Zealand, it is commonly marketed as ZAM.\nThe coating weights are similar to Zinc coatings, with ZM 240 used for products which will later be coil coated\nand ZM 450 for unpainted products.\nUnpainted ZM products have been used for roofing accessory and rainwater cladding applications in New\nZealand, but are more commonly found in factory pre-painted products.\n4.16.1.5 \nAZ Coatings \nAZ coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of aluminium. AZ coating, marketed as\nZincalume steel, is an alloy of zinc and aluminium which is now the most commonly used coating in New\nZealand for protecting steel roof and wall cladding.\nAZ coating is applied in the same way as other coatings, but with a pot temperature at about 140C higher than\ngalvanised coating, and it is rapidly cooled to provide a dual-phase microstructure.\nThe alloy consists of 50 to 60% aluminium, zinc, and a small addition of silicon. In New Zealand, the ratio is\nnominally 55:45. These percentage ratios are by mass; by volume, the percentage ratio changes to approximately\n80% aluminium and 20% zinc. Volume is probably a more realistic measure of its nature.\nThe alloy coating thickness generally used for steel roof and wall cladding is 150 g/m (AZ150). This coating is\napproximately the same thickness (0.04 mm) as Z275 zinc. AZ200 coatings are available as a substrate for\norganic coated products to be used in very severe environments.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n156\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nAn AZ coating protects steel both as a barrier and sacrificially, as the aluminium content provides a barrier, while\nthe zinc content of the coating will sacrifice itself to protect the base steel.\nThe AZ coating is finer grained than zinc alone and has a silver matt hue with a lightly visible spangle. This finish\nhas a relatively high level of initial reflectivity, which darkens over time.\nA thin acrylic film is applied during manufacture in New Zealand. The acrylic film acts as a roll forming lubricant\nand minimises finger marking and surface discolouration.\n4.16.1.6 \nAM Coatings \nAdding magnesium to an aluminium dominant zinc-aluminium alloy coating improves the cut edge corrosion\nresistance to a similar level as zinc coating, but still confers the improved surface protection and slower erosion\nrate of AZ coatings.\nSteel with a continuously hot-dipped coating of 47 - 57% aluminium and zinc, with the addition of 1 - 3%\nmagnesium by mass is designated in AS 1397:2011 as AM.\n4.16.2 \nStainless Steel \nStainless steel is a durable, corrosion-resistant material used in harsh environments when a non-weathering\nfinish is desired. Chromium forms a tenacious oxide protective film on stainless steel that is transparent and\nself-healing, as it will repair itself on exposure to the atmosphere.\nStainless steels are resistant to most chemicals, but are subject to crevice and pit corrosion (see Wet Storage).\nSome light surface staining known as tea staining may appear, but it is not damaging to the product.\nMost stainless steel roof and wall cladding, flashings and panels in New Zealand are made from the 300 series of\naustenitic non-magnetic stainless steel, which contain chromium, nickel, and manganese, with 304 and 316 being\nthe most common grades.\nGrade 304 stainless steel is an alloy of 18% chromium and 8% nickel that provides high corrosion resistance and\nis known as an all-purpose alloy.\nGrade 316 stainless steel should be specified where tea staining must be avoided. It contains 16% chromium, 10%\nnickel, with 2% molybdenum added, which increases resistance to staining and corrosion.\nGrade 445 ferritic stainless steel is now available in New Zealand, which combines the corrosion resistance of\ngrade 316 with formability approaching that of carbon steel. As the work hardening of 445 is much lower than\nwith austenitic grades, it can be formed in a similar way to carbon steel and is more easily sheared.\nGrade 445 stainless steel contains 22% chromium and 1.2% molybdenum and no nickel. It has lower thermal\nexpansion than other grades, so it is less likely to distort in the heat of the sun. The yield stress and hardness of\n445 is higher than 304 and 316, but the tensile strength and elongation properties are lower.\nT he corrosion resistance grade of 445 is similar to grade 316 in most marine and aggressive industrial\nenvironments.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n157\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nStainless steel is available in various mill finishes from dull matt to highly polished. The most common finishes\nfor roof cladding and sheet metal flashings, are those designated as 2B and 2D.\nThe 2B finish is a bright, cold-rolled finish that is highly reflective and 2D is a dull finish that is less reflective. BA\nis a bright reflective surface only suitable for decorative cladding in thicker gauges. Embossed patterns are\navailable that reduce visible distortion and minimise glare and reflection.\nStainless steel should not be cleaned with steel wool, but stainless steel wool or synthetic abrasive pads can be\nused. Cleaning should be done with care as roughening the surface may promote further stains.\nStainless steel fixings should be used with stainless steel sheet to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion. The fastener\ngrade must match the grade of the cladding.\nThere is no well-defined yield point for stainless steels. Fully annealed or standard annealed tempers are used for\nease of forming with 304 and 316 having an approximate yield strength of 290 mPa.\nAustenitic stainless steels require different forming techniques than other metals, and are known to be tougher\nand more difficult to form than carbon steel of the same thickness, e.g.,m when shearing stainless steel the\nequipment capacity should be increased between 30% - 50%. Because of the toughness of the metal, sharp\ncutting edges dull more quickly than when used with carbon steel.\nAlthough stainless steel is not much harder than mild steel, increased power is necessary to form it because of\nits high ultimate strength and its higher work hardening rate. As most forming machines are rated for the heaviest\ngauge steel this capacity should be de-rated by 40%.\nPrecautions should be taken not to contaminate the surface of the metal by inclusions from roll forming or\nfolding equipment. It can appear as rust spots on stainless steel, which is detrimental to performance. Stainless\nsteel coil and sheet can be supplied with a strippable film on both faces to avoid this contamination.\n4.16.3 \nAluminium \nThe aluminium alloys used in New Zealand for roof and wall cladding are included in the 5000 series.\nAluminium 5005 has excellent workability, weldability, and corrosion resistance.\nAluminium 5052 is a higher-strength marine-grade alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion in marine or\nindustrial environments.\nFollowing strain-hardening of aluminium alloys, tempering increases the ductility by low-temperature heating, and\ntheir description regarding hardness relates to the last number, e.g. H12 or H32.\nThe description of tempers given to aluminium alloys can be confusing because the different alloys are strain-\nhardened in different ways. As a result, different alloys with the same hardness description may have significantly\ndifferent yield strengths.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BA01 Required Temper for Aluminium Roof and Wall Cladding.\nExtract:\n\"...Using material of a different grade or hardness may severely affect the performance of\nthe cladding profile.

Zinc roof panels and flashings are\ncommonly 0.7 mm thick, although heavier gauges can be used. Zinc roofs are usually fully supported on sarking.\nThe staining potential of zinc run-off onto other surfaces is less than that of copper and lead. Flat zinc panels\nmust be adequately vented from underneath and are available with a high-build lacquer coating to help prevent\ncorrosion of the under-surface.\nZinc has approximately twice the thermal expansion coefficient as steel, so allowance for expansion must be\nmade accordingly.\nUnder 7 deg C the metal becomes brittle and is difficult to form without fracturing.\nZinc used for roof cladding generally contains small percentages of titanium and copper, which add to the\nproperties of pure zinc.\nZinc is also available in a range of pre-patinated surfaces.\n4.16.5 \n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n159\nThis is a controlled document.

Grade 122 is the most commonly used; it has been\ndeoxidized with phosphorus, which makes it weldable. The other grades cannot be welded but can be soldered.\nCopper darkens in reaction to the atmosphere. Near seawater or industrial sources of sulphur-containing gases, a\ngreen patina may develop in time. In different environments, the weathered colour may vary from dark brown to\nalmost black.\nCopper-containing alloys, such as brass and bronze, are available when different colours are requested or for\naccessories requiring greater strength.\nCopper is more malleable than steel sheets, and annealed copper is used for hand folding or where a high degree\nof formability is required. Roll formed roofing, wall cladding, gutters, spouts, and flashings are typically made\nfrom half hard copper. Copper roofs are normally fully supported on sarking.\nCopper must be protected from contamination when being processed with tools that have been used to process\nother metals because the resulting inclusions might cause pit corrosion.\nNeither copper nor run-off from copper should come in contact with less noble metals, as it will cause galvanic\ncorrosion. Avoid installing copper in contact with or receiving run-off from bituminous material or other acidic\nsurfaces, because it prevents the formation of the protective patina, causing discolouration and a shortened\nlifespan.\n4.16.6 \nLead \nHistorically, lead has been a popular choice for roof cladding and flashings, because it is naturally durable and is\neasily shaped using hand tools at ambient temperatures, without the need for softening or annealing.\nLead has an inherent lack of mechanical strength and is laid on solid sarking. It has high thermal movement and,\nover time, there is a risk of distortion and lead sheet cracking. Sheet lead is available in weights from 6 kg/m to\n40 kg/m.\nT he thinner the lead, the shorter the length should be. A maximum length of 1500 mm or less than 1.5 m\nis ideal.\nRun-off from a new lead roof can stain other metals with a white lead carbonate. Application of a proprietary\nproduct or boiled linseed oil and mineral turpentine mixture can avoid that happening.\nA factory applied cured coating that inhibits the contact between lead and oxides with water is available. The lack\nof contact reduces the potential for run-off staining other metals, and of lead entering ground water systems.\nAvoid using lead roofs to collect potable water.\n4.16.7 \nTranslucent Sheeting \nTranslucent sheeting should be manufactured from naturally durable products or have a protective surface film to\navoid ultra-violet degradation. (See Natural light for more information.)\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n160\nThis is a controlled document.

It is protected from UV\nerosion by a surface coating consisting of a gel or laminate. The composite is extruded and set over forming\nmoulds to match specific roofing profiles. \nGRP can often be used as translucent sheeting or it can be supplied with a clear, or opaque gel coat to the\nweather surface to provide a high level of corrosion resistance to aggressive atmospheres, where coated metal\nor even non-ferrous metals may not perform as required.\nExamples of use can be found in extreme environments such as wool scouring plants, fertilizer stores, tanneries,\nacid plants and smelters, abattoirs, compost plants, galvanizing plants, and buildings in harsh geothermal areas.\nWhere an entire roof is clad in GRP, (rather than individual sheets separated by metal sheets as in a typical case\nof translucent sheeting), it affects the trafficability and safety requirements. If a GRP roof is required to be\naccessible, it can be manufactured incorporating woven roving reinforcement into the resin matrix to make it\ntrafficable. Another option would be to install stainless steel safety mesh under the roof cladding, if required.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n161\nThis is a controlled document.

Cleaning should be done with care as roughening the surface may promote further stains.\nStainless steel fixings should be used with stainless steel sheet to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion. The fastener\ngrade must match the grade of the cladding.\nThere is no well-defined yield point for stainless steels. Fully annealed or standard annealed tempers are used for\nease of forming with 304 and 316 having an approximate yield strength of 290 mPa.\nAustenitic stainless steels require different forming techniques than other metals, and are known to be tougher\nand more difficult to form than carbon steel of the same thickness, e.g.,m when shearing stainless steel the\nequipment capacity should be increased between 30% - 50%. Because of the toughness of the metal, sharp\ncutting edges dull more quickly than when used with carbon steel.\nAlthough stainless steel is not much harder than mild steel, increased power is necessary to form it because of\nits high ultimate strength and its higher work hardening rate. As most forming machines are rated for the heaviest\ngauge steel this capacity should be de-rated by 40%.\nPrecautions should be taken not to contaminate the surface of the metal by inclusions from roll forming or\nfolding equipment.

The other grades cannot be welded but can be soldered.\nCopper darkens in reaction to the atmosphere. Near seawater or industrial sources of sulphur-containing gases, a\ngreen patina may develop in time. In different environments, the weathered colour may vary from dark brown to\nalmost black.\nCopper-containing alloys, such as brass and bronze, are available when different colours are requested or for\naccessories requiring greater strength.\nCopper is more malleable than steel sheets, and annealed copper is used for hand folding or where a high degree\nof formability is required. Roll formed roofing, wall cladding, gutters, spouts, and flashings are typically made\nfrom half hard copper. Copper roofs are normally fully supported on sarking.\nCopper must be protected from contamination when being processed with tools that have been used to process\nother metals because the resulting inclusions might cause pit corrosion.\nNeither copper nor run-off from copper should come in contact with less noble metals, as it will cause galvanic\ncorrosion. Avoid installing copper in contact with or receiving run-off from bituminous material or other acidic\nsurfaces, because it prevents the formation of the protective patina, causing discolouration and a shortened\nlifespan.\n4.16.6 \nLead \nHistorically, lead has been a popular choice for roof cladding and flashings, because it is naturally durable and is\neasily shaped using hand tools at ambient temperatures, without the need for softening or annealing.\nLead has an inherent lack of mechanical strength and is laid on solid sarking. It has high thermal movement and,\nover time, there is a risk of distortion and lead sheet cracking. Sheet lead is available in weights from 6 kg/m to\n40 kg/m.\nT he thinner the lead, the shorter the length should be.

Near seawater or industrial sources of sulphur-containing gases, a\ngreen patina may develop in time. In different environments, the weathered colour may vary from dark brown to\nalmost black.\nCopper-containing alloys, such as brass and bronze, are available when different colours are requested or for\naccessories requiring greater strength.\nCopper is more malleable than steel sheets, and annealed copper is used for hand folding or where a high degree\nof formability is required. Roll formed roofing, wall cladding, gutters, spouts, and flashings are typically made\nfrom half hard copper. Copper roofs are normally fully supported on sarking.\nCopper must be protected from contamination when being processed with tools that have been used to process\nother metals because the resulting inclusions might cause pit corrosion.\nNeither copper nor run-off from copper should come in contact with less noble metals, as it will cause galvanic\ncorrosion. Avoid installing copper in contact with or receiving run-off from bituminous material or other acidic\nsurfaces, because it prevents the formation of the protective patina, causing discolouration and a shortened\nlifespan.\n4.16.6 \nLead \nHistorically, lead has been a popular choice for roof cladding and flashings, because it is naturally durable and is\neasily shaped using hand tools at ambient temperatures, without the need for softening or annealing.\nLead has an inherent lack of mechanical strength and is laid on solid sarking. It has high thermal movement and,\nover time, there is a risk of distortion and lead sheet cracking. Sheet lead is available in weights from 6 kg/m to\n40 kg/m.\nT he thinner the lead, the shorter the length should be. A maximum length of 1500 mm or less than 1.5 m\nis ideal.\nRun-off from a new lead roof can stain other metals with a white lead carbonate. Application of a proprietary\nproduct or boiled linseed oil and mineral turpentine mixture can avoid that happening.\nA factory applied cured coating that inhibits the contact between lead and oxides with water is available. The lack\nof contact reduces the potential for run-off staining other metals, and of lead entering ground water systems.\nAvoid using lead roofs to collect potable water.\n4.16.7 \nTranslucent Sheeting \nTranslucent sheeting should be manufactured from naturally durable products or have a protective surface film to\navoid ultra-violet degradation.

It is protected from UV\nerosion by a surface coating consisting of a gel or laminate. The composite is extruded and set over forming\nmoulds to match specific roofing profiles. \nGRP can often be used as translucent sheeting or it can be supplied with a clear, or opaque gel coat to the\nweather surface to provide a high level of corrosion resistance to aggressive atmospheres, where coated metal\nor even non-ferrous metals may not perform as required.\nExamples of use can be found in extreme environments such as wool scouring plants, fertilizer stores, tanneries,\nacid plants and smelters, abattoirs, compost plants, galvanizing plants, and buildings in harsh geothermal areas.\nWhere an entire roof is clad in GRP, (rather than individual sheets separated by metal sheets as in a typical case\nof translucent sheeting), it affects the trafficability and safety requirements. If a GRP roof is required to be\naccessible, it can be manufactured incorporating woven roving reinforcement into the resin matrix to make it\ntrafficable.

The dry film builds are high compared to pre-\nprimed or coil-coated products and the films seal any micro-cracking of the metallic coating that may have\noccurred in the forming process.\nThe corrosion performance of the post-painted factory-applied finished products is influenced by the substrate.\nThe use of Aluminium Zinc metallic coating (AZ) has been proven to work extremely well with post-painted\nfinishes in almost all environments.\nThe coatings are durable with expected first-time recoating maintenance of over 15 years. Touch-up of these\ncoatings is possible as the same coating formulation can be applied in the field. As with any organic coating,\nthere will be a gradual breakdown of the resin systems which may result in chalking of the surface.\nChalking is the result of erosion of the surface coating and slight colour changes may occur as the surface resin\nis eroded. The extent of change depends on the pigments used and also the gloss level, a coating that started as\na matt finish will change very little while a gloss finish will appear to have changed more.\nGranule-textured finishes are created using crushed rock, comprising either natural rock or natural rock coated\nwith a ceramic finish containing light-fast inorganic pigments. Both the natural rock and ceramic-coated granules\nprovide exceptional long-term colour durability. The coatings used to adhere the granules to the substrate are\ndesigned to be flexible in all environments and, although durable, the coating is protected from UV by the UV\nopaque granules.\nA clear coating is applied to the granules during the coating process, which helps bond the granules into the\nadhesive base coating and provides a robust surface reducing any damage during the transportation and\ninstallation process. As this clear coat weathers, it exposes the natural or coated surface of the granules, which\nis slightly duller than the initial finish.\n4.18.3 \nPowder Coating \nPowder coating is generally used to colour match accessories used with pre-painted steel cladding and rainwater\ngoods. The use of powder coating on metallic coated steel roof and wall cladding and flashings is not\nrecommended for the following reasons.\nIt will fade at a noticeably different rate to adjacent pre-painted metal surfaces.\nPowder coated products are length limited by the size of the curing oven and cannot be re-formed after\ncoating.\nDrilling or cutting of the sheet after powder coating will create an exposed edge vulnerable to under-cut\ncorrosion.\nStandard powder coating does not have the corrosion resistance of pre-painted metal and is vulnerable to post\ncoating damage and edge creep corrosion.\nIt is difficult to obtain adhesion to powder coated surfaces when overpainting, and the remaining powder coat\nsurface may not provide a good substrate for such.\nPower coating may be used to colour match accessories but cannot be relied upon to increase durability, unless\nspecific pre-treatment and powder coating systems are specified and applied.\n4.18.4 \n 4 DURABILITY\n 18 \n 4.18 \n165\nThis is a controlled document.

Primers used on coated steel coil have anti-corrosive pigments which inhibits corrosion through an\nelectro-chemical reaction.\n4.18.1.3 \nTop Coat and Backer \nThis is the outer skin and it must give the desired appearance. In terms of durability, it provides a measure of\nbarrier coating while still being breathable, and prevents UV degradation of the primer.\nFunctionally the top coat must be hard enough to prevent excessive marring during profiling and installation; and\nwhen in use, it must:\nbe flexible enough to form to relatively tight bends without excessive micro-cracking;\nbe resistant to fade in NZ's harsh environment;\nwithstand extremes of temperature; and\nbe a suitable surface for the collection of potable water.\nMore recent innovations include solar reflectance technology to minimise the amount of solar heat gain gathered\nby the cladding\nBacker coats generally have the same primer and a thinner top coat than the upper surface. Double-sided systems\ncan be specified for areas where the underside is seen, but in external environments these will be exposed to salt\nspray and other contaminants, and it cannot be assumed that the underside will last as long as the rain washed\ntop surface - even with regular maintenance.\nAs paint formulations from different suppliers may have different performance characteristics, it is important that\ncladding and accessories are supplied from the same manufacturer as differing weathering characteristics may\nresult in visible variance in appearance.\nSurface coating must comply with AS/NZS 2728. Cladding and flashings must come from the same source and\nhave the same coating specification, so that fade rates are similar. Fade rates must not exceed those stipulated\nin AS/NZS 2728. All coatings must be lead free and suitable for the collection of drinking water.\nAS/NZS 2728 has been deemed ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as allowing accelerated testing to\ndetermine colour fastness and durability. Such tests have been found to be an unreliable indication of a system's\nperformance in real-life situations. MRM has therefore adopted an interpretation of this standard as the\ncompliance standard for its members. In the MRM standard, the four-year real-life testing for durability and colour\nfastness are clarified as being Normative (Compulsory).\n4.18.2 \nPost-Painted Factory Applied finish \nThis coating system is most commonly used for pressed metal tiles.\nWhere a coating is applied to a Metallic coated steel or Aluminium substrate after the profile of the roofing sheet\nhas been formed is referred to as a Post-Painted Factory Applied Finish. The metallic substrate may have a coil-\ncoated primer, coil-coated anti-fingerprint coating, a factory-applied post-painted primer or be cleaned and treated\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n164\nThis is a controlled document.

When a wall is discharging on to a roof, half the surface area of that wall (up to a\nmaximum height of 10 m), must be added to the catchment calculation.\n5.3.1.1 \nRoof Pitch \nThe COP calculations are based on the plane area of the roof (which is the sloping surface area of the roof), not\nthe plan area (which is the area covered by the roof).\n 5 \n 5.3 ROOF DRAINAGE DESIGN\n 3 \n 5 \n 5.3 \n172\nThis is a controlled document.

Where a 2% probability of flooding is unacceptable, a\nhigher figure should be used.\nInternal Gutters Commercial have a minimum factor of 2.2 as failure of these gutters is less likely to cause\nsevere damage and water run time may be longer. Short runs and steep pitches will reduce run time. (At\n250 mm/hr intensity and 3 degrees pitch, rain will take 2 minutes to travel 15 metres). For short runs, steeper\npitches and where the probability of flooding of 2% is unacceptable, a higher figure should be used.\nExternal Gutters no overflow have a minimum factor of 2.5, providing the building has a soffit. Otherwise, they\nshould be treated as an internal gutter.\nExternal Gutters with overflow have a minimum factor of 1, provided the building has a soffit, as occasional\noverflow is not likely to cause damage. To qualify as drained, the back of the gutter must be below the fascia\nheight and it must have a gap of at least 3 mm between the gutter and the fascia or cladding. This gap must be\nmaintained in all areas, including internal angles. External gutters to buildings without soffit must be provided\nwith a 10 mm drainage gap or be designed as an internal gutter.\nFor convenience, ARI maps are included in the calculation section which includes tables for gutter and valley\ncapacity for different rainfall intensities.\n5.3.3 \nMinimum Freeboard Values \nIn gutters where overflow can enter the structure, freeboard is necessary to allow for wave action, obstructions,\nand other unforeseen circumstances.

In practice, this is rarely commercially\nacceptable. With sound design and reasonable maintenance, a spouting life of 10 years or more is usually\nachieved when using the same material as the profiled metal roof.\nSpouting that is difficult to access for replacement should be specified in more durable, compatible materials.\n5.4.1.1 \nBay Windows \nE1/AS1 does not prescribe a need for a building to have spouting, it merely requires that concentrations of water\ngathered by structures does not enter the building or cause damage or nuisance to other property. This is\ntraditionally achieved by using gutters and downpipes to discharge roof catchments into stormwater drains.\nMinor wall projections such as bay windows and boxed penetrations are treated as part of the wall catchment and\nare typically excused from requiring spouting and downpipe, provided the plan view surface area of individual\nprojections does not exceed 5 m2.\n5.4.1.2 \nOutbuildings \nSmall outbuildings such as garden sheds up to 10 are also traditionally exempted from requiring spouting and\ndownpipes providing the discharge does not interfere with neighbouring buildings.\n5.4.2 \nGutter Capacity Design \nSpouting should be installed with the back lower than the fascia board or cladding to allow for draining of\noverflow water through the gap between the gutter back and the fascia.\nA 2 mm gap between the back of the gutter and the fascia will give a discharge area equal to the diameter of a\n 5 \n 5.4 GUTTERS\n 5 \n 5.4 \n181\nThis is a controlled document.

A designed\noutlet is preferred, either a gutter bracket creating a minimum 6 mm space stop end, a weir, a raised outlet above\nthe spouting sole, a slotted front, or a low fronted gutter.\nA weir stop-end, or an outlet with a top edge above the sole of the gutter, can be used to increase outlet capacity.\n5.4.2.1 \nGutter Fall \nAll gutters should have a minimum fall of 1:500 (2 mm in 1 m). A 1:200 (5 mm in 1 m) fall will give faster water\nflow and better self-cleaning, but it may look unattractive on external spouting due to misalignment with the\nfascia, and exposure of roof sheet ends, on longer lengths\n5.4.2.1A Effect of Gutter Fall on Drainage Capacity\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0 1 in \n100\n1 in \n200\n1 in \n300\n1 in \n400\n1 in \n500\n1in \n1000\nGutter Fall Ratio\nComparative roof area \n(m ) drained\n2\n5.4.2.2 \nMaximum Gutter Length \nAll gutters are subject to expansion. Maximum gutter-length is determined by the type of metal and its colour.\nWhere gutters have an allowance for expansion (such as an external gutter on a typical gutter bracket or an\ninternal gutter with sliding clips), lengths should be restricted to 25 m in steel and 12 m for copper or aluminium.\nAn expansion joint can be either a sump, rainwater head or a saddle flashing. Gutters that are directly through-\nfastened to the fascia or eaves purlin will not be free to move and should be restricted to a maximum of 12 m.\nThrough-fastened gutters are not recommended as they are difficult to replace.\n5.4.2.3 \nSpouting Support Systems \nThe spouting bracket system must withstand the potential weight of a gutter full of water. In snow load\nareas, spouting may be fitted with snow straps and brackets at a maximum of 600 mm centres to\nwithstand the additional potential weight of any snow build-up.\n 5 \n 5.4 GUTTERS\n 5 \n 5.4 \n182\nThis is a controlled document.

Brackets for unpainted spouting should be\nhot dipped galvanised or have an AZ150 or Z450 or equivalent coating. Unpainted Z275 brackets are not\nacceptable nor are painted or unpainted electro-plated brackets. Brackets for pre-painted spouting must be\npainted or powder-coated before installation, where they must be colour-matched. In severe marine areas,\nbrackets should be epoxy primed before powder coating or should be formed from non-ferrous metal.\n5.4.2.3A Spouting Support System Durability\nBrackets for external gutters should be located close to all stop-ends, at both ends of sumps and rain-heads at a\nmaximum of 750 mm spacing for gutters less than 180 mm wide, and at 600 mm for gutters 180 - 300 mm wide.\nBrackets must be installed to provide a 1:500 (2 mm per metre) minimum gutter gradient towards the outlets.\n5.4.3 \nInternal Corners \nWhen the back of a gutter is cut down to allow the valley to discharge into it, the gutter capacity is affected. In\nthese cases, gutter calculations should allow for 20 mm less water height, and a min 3 mm spacer should be\nattached to the back of the gutter (or fascia) at the internal corner to maintain the clearance between the gutter\nand the fascia.\n5.4.4 \nConcealed Fascia Gutters \nConcealed gutter systems are bespoke or proprietary systems that run inside the fascia.\n 5 \n 5.4 GUTTERS\n 5 \n 5.4 \n183\nThis is a controlled document.

Where butyl\ngutters are used, the metal and flashings should be separated from wet contact with the butyl rubber.\n5.4.5A Separation of Butyl Gutter and Metal Roofing\nParapet Cap\nKick-out to avoid \ncontact\nLap-seal Tape\nButyl Gutter\nKick-out to \navoid wet area\nSuitable non-ferrous metals include 0.9 mm aluminium, 0.6 mm stainless steel, and 0.6 mm copper. Contact\nbetween coated metal products and copper or stainless steel must be avoided because it will lead to early\ncorrosion. Splashback or runoff from copper onto coated metal can have the same effect.\n5.4.5.1 \nInternal Gutter Design Features \nAll internal gutters must have upstands that are hooked or returned. Gutters that return under the\neaves are not recommended as this design makes removal for replacement more difficult.\n 5 \n 5.4 GUTTERS\n 5 \n 5.4 \n184\nThis is a controlled document.

A width to\nheight ratio of 2:1 plus freeboard gives maximum flow as it minimises wet surface area for a given cross-\nsectional area.\nA sharp direction change in flow of an internal gutter will affect discharge capacity. Where two buildings\nmeet at an angle, each gutter must be drained separately, or a specific discharge capacity calculation\nmust be applied.\nInternal gutters should have an expansion joint at the stop-end.\nOutflows from internal gutters may be scuppers or weirs.\n5.4.5.1B Scupper\n5.4.5.1C Weir\n 5 \n 5.4 GUTTERS\n 5 \n 5.4 \n185\nThis is a controlled document.

As these\nhave reduced cross-section area compared to a symmetrical valley at the same (lower) pitch, it is often\nnecessary to increase the valley dimensions. Increasing the depth has the biggest effect on capacity. Greater\ndepth can be gained by using 10 mm ply valley boards, standing purlins on edge, or fitting valley boards flush with\nthe rafter. The consequences that a deeper valley will have on the capacity of the gutter it discharges into must\nalso be considered.\nA valley bae is required in all cases where a valley has a change of angle or when the dierence in roof pitch\nexceeds 10 deg .

The best way to increase the head\nis to discharge the open end of the gutter into a rainwater head or sump. Swirl at the outlet reduces its\nperformance, so the positioning of the outlet is important.\nOutlets must be placed at a distance less than or equal to the outlet diameter from the nearest vertical\nside of the sump.\nRainwater heads are situated outside the building envelope, and sumps are internally located.\nThey both serve to increase the head of water entering a downpipe and to provide an overflow capacity to safely\ndischarge water when the downpipe capacity is compromised or exceeded. The overflow should be obvious so\ndischarging water warns the occupant that the downpipe capacity has been exceeded or the primary downpipe is\nblocked.\n5.6A Internal Gutter Discharging into a Rainwater Head\nLine of gutter sole\nDimension Y equal to \ndepth of gutter at outflow\nY\nY\nZ\nW\nDimension\nW equal to \nthe width of \nthe gutter \nor scupper, \nplus 3mm\nDimension Z \nequals a minimum \nof 25 mm\n 5 \n 5.6 OUTLETS\n 6 \n 5 \n 5.6 \n193\nThis is a controlled document.

The\ncross-sectional area of the overflow must be at least equal to that of the required downpipe size for the\ncatchment being served. The lower edge of the overflow must be at least 25 mm below the sole of the\ngutter, and the upper edge must be at least 25 mm below the upper edge of the gutter.\n5.6.2 \nSumps \nSumps can be any width; many are pre-made in plastic, ready for insertion. Sumps must have an outlet positioned\nbelow the sole of the gutter to increase the water head at the outlet.\n 5 \n 5.6 OUTLETS\n 6 \n 5 \n 5.6 \n194\nThis is a controlled document.

These are often a secondary pipe overflow, with the outlet height positioned\nabove the level of the primary outlet. Internal sumps must also be sealed against the sides and sole of the gutter.\n5.6.2B Sump with Overflow\nInternal sump \nwith overt \noverflow to \nground level\nAn internal sump should have a guard that prevents debris from blocking the outlet. A removable aluminium\nexpanded-metal box can be fitted at a minimum of 40 mm below the sole of the gutter. Because the top is flat, it\nis unlikely that the entire surface area of the outlet can become blocked, so it is preferable to balloon-type\nguards. A leaf guard should have a horizontal surface area of at least four times the size of the downpipe outlet\narea and should be installed at roughly mid-height of the sump depth. Gratings can cause sump blockage, and this\ncan reduce the outlet capacity.\n 5 \n 5.6 OUTLETS\n 6 \n 5 \n 5.6 \n195\nThis is a controlled document.

Gratings or guards should be cleared of accumulated debris regularly as part\nof normal maintenance.\n5.6.3 \nOverflows \nOverflows must discharge clear of the building to clearly show that downpipe capacity has been\nexceeded; it should be an obvious indication that the gutters need maintenance.\nA scupper outlet to a rainwater head must have a cross-sectional area equal to 1 times that of the downpipe\noutlet. The bottom of the overflow must be no higher than 25 mm below the bottom of the spouting.\nWhere the position of an outlet of a parapet wall gutter is on an outside wall, any scupper outflow should\ndischarge into a rainwater head.\n 5 \n 5.6 OUTLETS\n 6 \n 5 \n 5.6 \n196\nThis is a controlled document.

All sump\ndownpipes must be able to withstand a water pressure test with an applied head of 1.5 m of water\nwithout leakage.\nTo avoid any water back-up if the drain capacity is overloaded or obstructed, an air-break should be provided for\nall downpipes to ensure that water does not back up the downpipe.\nAll exterior downpipes must discharge freely over a grated gully trap or into an oversized pipe which\nmust be a minimum of 50 mm above the adjacent ground level.\nDownpipe retaining brackets, otherwise known as stand-off clips, are used to align the downpipe\nbetween the dropper and and discharge sump. Normally, they are situated near both ends of the\ndownpipe, with intermediate brackets placed in high traffic areas or where the span is greater than 3 m.\n5.7A Downpipe Draining into a Grated Gully Trap\n 5 \n 5.7 DOWNPIPES\n 7 \n 5 \n 5.7 \n197\nThis is a controlled document.

Discharging water off an inert surface\nonto unpainted galvanised surfaces can cause corrosion. See 4.11 Inert Catchment.\nHorizontally run PVC downpipes and gutters require a greater provision for expansion than metal, particularly if\nthey are painted a dark colour. Provision for expansion with PVC gutters and downpipes should be made\naccording to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nWhen rainwater is collected into a water tank, there is often not enough distance to obtain\nadequate fall for one downpipe outlet. In such cases, or whenever the roof design pre-empts a\ncontinuous spouting to the tank, it is possible to have several sealed downpipes (some of which can\nrun underground) to discharge into the tank. The outlet discharging into such pipes should be a\nrainwater head to avoid flooding.\n5.7C Collecting Rainwater in Tanks\n300 mm fall\nRainwater heads\n 5 \n 5.7 DOWNPIPES\n 7 \n 5 \n 5.7 \n198\nThis is a controlled document.

A spreader should be used over multiple troughs.\nFor corrugate, a spreader should not discharge into a lapped trough. When using the COP calculator, discharge\nmay be into a lapped trough of a trapezoidal or a trough profile.\nThe area of discharge holes from a spreader should equal the cross-sectional area of the downpipe.\nThe 5.8.1 Maximum Area Above Spreader Calculator enables users to determine the maximum upper roof\narea that a lower roof can discharge for a given combination of rainfall intensity, roofing profile, and lower roof\npitch.\n5.8A Downpipe Spreader design\nUse the online calculator\nto determine the maximum \narea above spreader, based\non discharge capacity of the\nlower roof.\nArea of the discharge holes\n= cross sectional area \nof the downpipe.\nLower roof drainage capacity determines maximum\narea above \nspreader.

When a wall is discharging on to a roof, half the surface area of that wall (up to a\nmaximum height of 10 m), must be added to the catchment calculation.\n5.3.1.1 \nRoof Pitch \nThe COP calculations are based on the plane area of the roof (which is the sloping surface area of the roof), not\nthe plan area (which is the area covered by the roof).\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 3 \n 5 \n 5.3 \n172\nThis is a controlled document.

Where a 2% probability of flooding is unacceptable, a\nhigher figure should be used.\nInternal Gutters Commercial have a minimum factor of 2.2 as failure of these gutters is less likely to cause\nsevere damage and water run time may be longer. Short runs and steep pitches will reduce run time. (At\n250 mm/hr intensity and 3 degrees pitch, rain will take 2 minutes to travel 15 metres). For short runs, steeper\npitches and where the probability of flooding of 2% is unacceptable, a higher figure should be used.\nExternal Gutters no overflow have a minimum factor of 2.5, providing the building has a soffit. Otherwise, they\nshould be treated as an internal gutter.\nExternal Gutters with overflow have a minimum factor of 1, provided the building has a soffit, as occasional\noverflow is not likely to cause damage. To qualify as drained, the back of the gutter must be below the fascia\nheight and it must have a gap of at least 3 mm between the gutter and the fascia or cladding. This gap must be\nmaintained in all areas, including internal angles. External gutters to buildings without soffit must be provided\nwith a 10 mm drainage gap or be designed as an internal gutter.\nFor convenience, ARI maps are included in the calculation section which includes tables for gutter and valley\ncapacity for different rainfall intensities.\n5.3.3 \nMinimum Freeboard Values \nIn gutters where overflow can enter the structure, freeboard is necessary to allow for wave action, obstructions,\nand other unforeseen circumstances. Capacity Calculations allow for these minimum freeboard values.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 3 \n 5 \n 5.3 \n179\nThis is a controlled document.

In practice, this is rarely commercially\nacceptable. With sound design and reasonable maintenance, a spouting life of 10 years or more is usually\nachieved when using the same material as the profiled metal roof.\nSpouting that is difficult to access for replacement should be specified in more durable, compatible materials.\n5.4.1.1 \nBay Windows \nE1/AS1 does not prescribe a need for a building to have spouting, it merely requires that concentrations of water\ngathered by structures does not enter the building or cause damage or nuisance to other property. This is\ntraditionally achieved by using gutters and downpipes to discharge roof catchments into stormwater drains.\nMinor wall projections such as bay windows and boxed penetrations are treated as part of the wall catchment and\nare typically excused from requiring spouting and downpipe, provided the plan view surface area of individual\nprojections does not exceed 5 m2.\n5.4.1.2 \nOutbuildings \nSmall outbuildings such as garden sheds up to 10 are also traditionally exempted from requiring spouting and\ndownpipes providing the discharge does not interfere with neighbouring buildings.\n5.4.2 \nGutter Capacity Design \nSpouting should be installed with the back lower than the fascia board or cladding to allow for draining of\noverflow water through the gap between the gutter back and the fascia.\nA 2 mm gap between the back of the gutter and the fascia will give a discharge area equal to the diameter of a\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 5 \n 5.4 \n181\nThis is a controlled document.

A designed\noutlet is preferred, either a gutter bracket creating a minimum 6 mm space stop end, a weir, a raised outlet above\nthe spouting sole, a slotted front, or a low fronted gutter.\nA weir stop-end, or an outlet with a top edge above the sole of the gutter, can be used to increase outlet capacity.\n5.4.2.1 \nGutter Fall \nAll gutters should have a minimum fall of 1:500 (2 mm in 1 m). A 1:200 (5 mm in 1 m) fall will give faster water\nflow and better self-cleaning, but it may look unattractive on external spouting due to misalignment with the\nfascia, and exposure of roof sheet ends, on longer lengths\n5.4.2.1A Effect of Gutter Fall on Drainage Capacity\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0 1 in \n100\n1 in \n200\n1 in \n300\n1 in \n400\n1 in \n500\n1in \n1000\nGutter Fall Ratio\nComparative roof area \n(m ) drained\n2\n5.4.2.2 \nMaximum Gutter Length \nAll gutters are subject to expansion. Maximum gutter-length is determined by the type of metal and its colour.\nWhere gutters have an allowance for expansion (such as an external gutter on a typical gutter bracket or an\ninternal gutter with sliding clips), lengths should be restricted to 25 m in steel and 12 m for copper or aluminium.\nAn expansion joint can be either a sump, rainwater head or a saddle flashing. Gutters that are directly through-\nfastened to the fascia or eaves purlin will not be free to move and should be restricted to a maximum of 12 m.\nThrough-fastened gutters are not recommended as they are difficult to replace.\n5.4.2.3 \nSpouting Support Systems \nThe spouting bracket system must withstand the potential weight of a gutter full of water. In snow load\nareas, spouting may be fitted with snow straps and brackets at a maximum of 600 mm centres to\nwithstand the additional potential weight of any snow build-up.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 5 \n 5.4 \n182\nThis is a controlled document.

Brackets for unpainted spouting should be\nhot dipped galvanised or have an AZ150 or Z450 or equivalent coating. Unpainted Z275 brackets are not\nacceptable nor are painted or unpainted electro-plated brackets. Brackets for pre-painted spouting must be\npainted or powder-coated before installation, where they must be colour-matched. In severe marine areas,\nbrackets should be epoxy primed before powder coating or should be formed from non-ferrous metal.\n5.4.2.3A Spouting Support System Durability\nBrackets for external gutters should be located close to all stop-ends, at both ends of sumps and rain-heads at a\nmaximum of 750 mm spacing for gutters less than 180 mm wide, and at 600 mm for gutters 180 - 300 mm wide.\nBrackets must be installed to provide a 1:500 (2 mm per metre) minimum gutter gradient towards the outlets.\n5.4.3 \nInternal Corners \nWhen the back of a gutter is cut down to allow the valley to discharge into it, the gutter capacity is affected. In\nthese cases, gutter calculations should allow for 20 mm less water height, and a min 3 mm spacer should be\nattached to the back of the gutter (or fascia) at the internal corner to maintain the clearance between the gutter\nand the fascia.\n5.4.4 \nConcealed Fascia Gutters \nConcealed gutter systems are bespoke or proprietary systems that run inside the fascia.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 5 \n 5.4 \n183\nThis is a controlled document.

Where butyl\ngutters are used, the metal and flashings should be separated from wet contact with the butyl rubber.\n5.4.5A Separation of Butyl Gutter and Metal Roofing\nParapet Cap\nKick-out to avoid \ncontact\nLap-seal Tape\nButyl Gutter\nKick-out to \navoid wet area\nSuitable non-ferrous metals include 0.9 mm aluminium, 0.6 mm stainless steel, and 0.6 mm copper. Contact\nbetween coated metal products and copper or stainless steel must be avoided because it will lead to early\ncorrosion. Splashback or runoff from copper onto coated metal can have the same effect.\n5.4.5.1 \nInternal Gutter Design Features \nAll internal gutters must have upstands that are hooked or returned. Gutters that return under the\neaves are not recommended as this design makes removal for replacement more difficult.\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 5 \n 5.4 \n184\nThis is a controlled document.

A width to\nheight ratio of 2:1 plus freeboard gives maximum flow as it minimises wet surface area for a given cross-\nsectional area.\nA sharp direction change in flow of an internal gutter will affect discharge capacity. Where two buildings\nmeet at an angle, each gutter must be drained separately, or a specific discharge capacity calculation\nmust be applied.\nInternal gutters should have an expansion joint at the stop-end.\nOutflows from internal gutters may be scuppers or weirs.\n5.4.5.1B Scupper\n5.4.5.1C Weir\n 5 ROOF DRAINAGE\n 5 \n 5 \n 5.4 \n185\nThis is a controlled document.

As these\nhave reduced cross-section area compared to a symmetrical valley at the same (lower) pitch, it is often\nnecessary to increase the valley dimensions. Increasing the depth has the biggest effect on capacity. Greater\ndepth can be gained by using 10 mm ply valley boards, standing purlins on edge, or fitting valley boards flush with\nthe rafter. The consequences that a deeper valley will have on the capacity of the gutter it discharges into must\nalso be considered.\nA valley bae is required in all cases where a valley has a change of angle or when the dierence in roof pitch\nexceeds 10 deg .

The Code of Practice deals with External Moisture in\nfour sections, allowing for more detailed discussion. The solutions in the COP relate to all buildings and are not\nlimited to buildings within the scope of NZS 3604.\nIncluded in the COP under External Moisture:\nObjectives, Functional Requirements, Performance Requirements, and Limits of the NZBC Clause E2. The second\nhalf highlights the scope and extent of Acceptable Solution E2/AS1.\n7 External Moisture Roofing discusses the external moisture requirements and strategies for dealing with\nexternal moisture where it concerns metal roof and wall cladding.\n8 External Moisture Flashings suggests strategies of managing external moisture with a specific focus on\nflashings.\n9 External Moisture Penetrations focus specifically on managing external moisture and preventing leaks\naround penetrations.\n 6 \n 6 \n203\nThis is a controlled document.

The ability of side laps or end laps to withstand\nwater penetration also becomes more critical at low pitches, but a good design of flashings can ensure\nweathertightness in extreme conditions.\nA printable bulletin regarding re-roofing low pitched trough section roofs is available at: BSP01 Replacing\nTrough Section Roofs at a 1 deg Pitch.\nExtract:\n\"Roof replacement with a \"like with like\" does not require a building consent (Exemptions Guidance for\nSchedule 1 of the Building Act 2004, Fifth edition August 2020). An existing flat roof that has met the\nperformance requirements of E2-External Moisture, and B2-Durability, can be replaced with a\ncomparable product, without re-pitching the roof.\"\n 7 \n 7.1 ROOF PITCH\n 1 \n 7 \n 7.1 \n208\nThis is a controlled document.

Wind baffles are more\neffective in preventing water ingress than increasing the flashing cover width.\n7.1.1B Exceptions to the Minimum Recommended Roof Cladding Pitch\nrequirements:\nCurved roofs, where, by design, the minimum pitch at the crest is always less than the prescribed minimum\npitch. In these cases, the pitch at the eaves must comply with the profile's minimum pitch, and the pitch at the\nupper end of a terminated arc must be a minimum of 3 deg . (See 15.1 Curved Roofs).\nThe back curbs of penetration flashings where the minimum pitch is 1.5 deg . (See 9 External Moisture\nPenetrations).\nReroofing trough section roofs at less 3 deg , where satisfies the requirements and considerations of Building\nwork that does not require a building consent (Exemptions Guidance for Schedule 1 of the Building Act 2004)\nFifth edition August 2020.

The rib height and\nspacing of trapezoidal profiles also affects its shedding ability.\n For example: At a rainfall intensity of 200 mm/hour, a five-rib trapezoidal profile at 3 deg , with a rib height of\n27 mm, can have a run of 90 m.\nThe 7.1.4 Maximum Run Calculator can calculate capacities for any known profile.\n7.1.3 \nRoof Drainage Capacity \nThe capacity of a roof profile to drain water is determined by its geometry and the roof pitch. The catchment area\nis the distance between rib centres times the length, and the effective cross-section area and the wetted\nperimeter is taken to the height of the overlap on corrugate, or capillary bead on trapezoidal and trough section\nprofiles.\nThe 7.1.4 Maximum Run Calculator gives the maximum length that a roof can drain at a given pitch and\nrainfall intensity. The manufacturer's data can be accessed from the drop-down box; for other profiles, the data\ncan be entered manually into the worksheet.\n 7 \n 7.1 ROOF PITCH\n 1 \n 7 \n 7.1 \n209\nThis is a controlled document.

Deformed sheeting will cause water to pond around the seal.\nSwarf should be removed from under the sealing washer as it will not only cause staining but also interfere\nwith the seal.\n 7 \n 7.2 FASTENING ROOFING\n 2 \n 7 \n 7.2 \n211\nThis is a controlled document.

The energy produced should be absorbed without damage to the\ncladding, fixings or structure. The recommendations in this section are specific to preventing damage and leaks\nthrough thermal movement. Thermal movement can also cause disturbing noise levels in dwellings with shorter\nmember lengths than those recommended in this section. (See 12.1 Roof Noise.)\nThe ribs of metal trapezoidal or corrugated roof and wall cladding absorb expansion across the width of the\nsheets, but special provisions are needed over the sheets' length.\nMuch of the longitudinal expansion is taken up by the bowing of the sheet between fastened supports. The extent\nto which this happens depends on the profile strength and support spacings.\nFailure by thermal expansion normally results in shearing of the fastener. Fasteners into lightweight steel purlins\nup to 3 mm in thickness are less vulnerable as they tend to rotate rather than be subjected to repeated bending\nresulting in fatigue failure. Fasteners into hot rolled steel sections or timber are far more vulnerable to this mode\nof failure and in all run lengths over 20 metres provision for expansion must be made when fastening into such\nsupports.\nWhere overlapping sheets are fastened through the ends, they must be considered as one length to calculate\nthermal movement. Unfastened end laps are not recommended.\nWall cladding does not require the same provisions as roof cladding, because of solar radiation angle.\nOversized holes and washers give some room for expansion and contraction, but it is not enough to allow\nmovement without stress or distortion over long spans. In such cases, a step joint should be used. (See 8.5.4.3B\nStepped Roof Flashing)\n7.3.1 \nTemperature Range \nRanges of temperature likely to be experienced in NZ by different steel cladding are:\n7.3.1A Steel Cladding Temperature Ranges\nMax/Min Roof Temp deg C\n No Wind\nInsulated\nLight colour\n+60 deg -15 deg \n= 75 deg \nInsulated\nDark colour\n+80 deg -15 deg \n= 95 deg \nUninsulated\nLight colour\n+50 deg -10 deg \n= 60 deg \nUninsulated\nDark colour\n+65 deg -10 deg \n= 75 deg \nAluminium and zinc, which have twice the expansion rate of steel, do not necessarily expand to this\ndegree because of the different characteristics of mass, emittance, and radiance which affects\ntheir temperature range. Copper expands one and a half times as much as steel, and stainless steel\ncan expand up to 1.5 times as much as steel depending on composition.\n 7 \n 7.3 THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION\n 3 \n 7 \n 7.3 \n212\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nThe theoretical expansion of steel roof cladding in mm is 12 x temperature change x length in\nmetres/1000.\nSteel expansion rates can be calculated as follows:\nGiven a length (e.g., 30 m) and that the material (e.g., a light-coloured uninsulated roof) moves\nthrough a 60 deg C range (e.g., + 50 deg C -10 deg C), the theoretical increase in length is 12 x 60 x 30/1000 =\n21.6 mm.\nThis amount of movement of roof cladding and components does not have to be provided for in\npractice, because:\nThe building also expands with the ambient temperature, although to a lesser degree.\nFasteners into light gauge purlins will roll rather than bend. The purlin flange may also roll to a\ndegree.\nThe roof cladding bows between purlins when it is constrained. Sighting down a corrugated steel\nroof on a warm sunny day will show an undulating line compared to a straight line when the roof\nis cool. The forces created by expansion and contraction are self-levelling, i.e., each component\nmoves under load until the resisting force is more than the expansion force.\nWhen a length of sheeting is solid fastened at the centre and unconstrained at either end, the\nmovement is towards the ends of the sheeting; meaning the actual expansion or contraction\nmovement is only half that of a full length of roof or wall cladding fastened at one end. Special\ndesign of the ridge or head barge flashing is required in these cases to allow free movement.\nAlternatively, sheets can be solidly fixed at the upper region, so all expansion takes place in the\nlower part of the sheet towards the eaves.\n7.3.2 \nRoof Cladding Expansion Provisions \nThe expansion of roof cladding depends on the materials, the constraints imposed by the fixing, the heat paths in\nthe building and the actual temperature. The following graphics are indicative of favourable and unfavourable\nconditions for thermal expansion and suggest what these are. They show the lengths under both sets of\nconditions above which special provision needs to be made to accommodate thermal expansion.\n 7 \n 7.3 THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION\n 3 \n 7 \n 7.3 \n213\nThis is a controlled document.

When the sheets are too long to be transported or exceed the longest\nrecommended length (see 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion Provisions), the transverse or end lap joint can\nbe avoided by using a waterfall step. (See 8.5.4.3A Step Apron Details)\nWhen long lengths outside the capacity of available transport are required, secret-fixed roof cladding can be\nsupplied by using an onsite roll-forming machine.\nWhere end laps are unavoidable, a sealed joint should be made using sealant at both ends of the lap. The upper\nseal is critical as condensation entering the upper side of the lap from underneath can cause rapid corrosion.\n(See 14.11.1 Sealing End Laps.) The sheets are fixed to the purlin using screw fixings with a minimum lap of\n150 mm. For pitches less than 10 deg , a 200 mm lap is recommended.\nThe two lengths should be regarded as one length for expansion provisions.\n7.4.1 \nWall Cladding End Laps \nA printable bulletin is availble at: BEL01 End Laps in Wall Cladding.\nThe bulletin is identical to the content below.\nAs with roofing, wall cladding sheets should, wherever possible, be laid in a single continuous length. Where this\nis not feasible due to excessive length or other constraints, there are options for lapping.\nWhen the internal environment is dry and the wall is unlined, sheets can be simply end-lapped by approximately\n150 mm. In dwellings, lined buildings, and buildings with moist internal environments, the laps should be sealed at\nboth ends as per roof laps. The downside of end lapping is that there are four layers of material at the side\nlap/end lap junction. This often leads to an untidy join.\nThe preferred option where aesthetics must be considered is not to end-lap the sheets, but to have a zed flashing\nunder the upper sheet and over the lower, with cover as shown in 8.4F Barge Flashing Cover - Trapezoidal\nand Secret Fixed Table and 8.4J Transverse Apron Flashing Cover Table. This is both tidier and\nallows the sheets to thermally expand individually.\n 7 \n 7.4 END LAPS\n 7 \n 7.4 \n216\nThis is a controlled document.

The energy produced should be absorbed without damage to the\ncladding, fixings or structure. The recommendations in this section are specific to preventing damage and leaks\nthrough thermal movement. Thermal movement can also cause disturbing noise levels in dwellings with shorter\nmember lengths than those recommended in this section. (See 12.1 Roof Noise.)\nThe ribs of metal trapezoidal or corrugated roof and wall cladding absorb expansion across the width of the\nsheets, but special provisions are needed over the sheets' length.\nMuch of the longitudinal expansion is taken up by the bowing of the sheet between fastened supports. The extent\nto which this happens depends on the profile strength and support spacings.\nFailure by thermal expansion normally results in shearing of the fastener. Fasteners into lightweight steel purlins\nup to 3 mm in thickness are less vulnerable as they tend to rotate rather than be subjected to repeated bending\nresulting in fatigue failure. Fasteners into hot rolled steel sections or timber are far more vulnerable to this mode\nof failure and in all run lengths over 20 metres provision for expansion must be made when fastening into such\nsupports.\nWhere overlapping sheets are fastened through the ends, they must be considered as one length to calculate\nthermal movement. Unfastened end laps are not recommended.\nWall cladding does not require the same provisions as roof cladding, because of solar radiation angle.\nOversized holes and washers give some room for expansion and contraction, but it is not enough to allow\nmovement without stress or distortion over long spans. In such cases, a step joint should be used. (See 8.5.4.3B\nStepped Roof Flashing)\n7.3.1 \nTemperature Range \nRanges of temperature likely to be experienced in NZ by different steel cladding are:\n7.3.1A Steel Cladding Temperature Ranges\nMax/Min Roof Temp deg C\n No Wind\nInsulated\nLight colour\n+60 deg -15 deg \n= 75 deg \nInsulated\nDark colour\n+80 deg -15 deg \n= 95 deg \nUninsulated\nLight colour\n+50 deg -10 deg \n= 60 deg \nUninsulated\nDark colour\n+65 deg -10 deg \n= 75 deg \nAluminium and zinc, which have twice the expansion rate of steel, do not necessarily expand to this\ndegree because of the different characteristics of mass, emittance, and radiance which affects\ntheir temperature range. Copper expands one and a half times as much as steel, and stainless steel\ncan expand up to 1.5 times as much as steel depending on composition.\n 7 EXTERNAL MOISTURE ROOFING\n 7 \n 3 \n 7 \n 7.3 \n212\nThis is a controlled document.

The purlin flange may also roll to a\ndegree.\nThe roof cladding bows between purlins when it is constrained. Sighting down a corrugated steel\nroof on a warm sunny day will show an undulating line compared to a straight line when the roof\nis cool. The forces created by expansion and contraction are self-levelling, i.e., each component\nmoves under load until the resisting force is more than the expansion force.\nWhen a length of sheeting is solid fastened at the centre and unconstrained at either end, the\nmovement is towards the ends of the sheeting; meaning the actual expansion or contraction\nmovement is only half that of a full length of roof or wall cladding fastened at one end. Special\ndesign of the ridge or head barge flashing is required in these cases to allow free movement.\nAlternatively, sheets can be solidly fixed at the upper region, so all expansion takes place in the\nlower part of the sheet towards the eaves.\n7.3.2 \nRoof Cladding Expansion Provisions \nThe expansion of roof cladding depends on the materials, the constraints imposed by the fixing, the heat paths in\nthe building and the actual temperature. The following graphics are indicative of favourable and unfavourable\nconditions for thermal expansion and suggest what these are.

    "content": "8 \nExternal Moisture\nFlashings \nThis section should be read in conjunction with 6 External Moisture Overview and 9 External\nMoisture Penetrations.\nThe purpose of a flashing is to divert water away from any point of entry and to make a building weatherproof.\nFlashings are not only required to weather the many junctions on a roof or wall structure but are often a highly\nvisible part of the roof and wall cladding design. Therefore, they perform an important role in the aesthetic\nappearance of the building.\nIt takes longer to make and install flashings than fixing roof or wall cladding, so designers should be aware of the\ncost effects of design complexity.\nSee it in action with Roofguide\nMany common flashing solutions are expanded on with step-by-step, interactive 3D instructions in the\nRANZ Roofing Guide, developed by the Roofing Association of New Zealand in association with the\nNZMRM.\nWorks on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.\nFind out more at www.roofguide.co.nz\n 8 \n 8 \n218\nThis is a controlled document.

If flashings are required to match the colour of the profiled cladding, it is necessary for the pre-painted\nflat sheet or coil to be made by the same manufacturer, using the same process. When it is not possible, or if\ndifferent materials are intended or specified, the alternative materials should be compatible considering both\ncontact and runoff. (See 4.9.4 Compatibility Table)\nAll flashings must be fabricated from a ductile material and designed for lateral strength by folding, stiffening, or\nribbing on external edges, with a maximum unstiffened width of 300 mm.\nVertical faces of flashings such as barges and fascia can exhibit oil canning. This can be minimised by using\nheavier gauge material, by forming stiffeners, or by providing clip fastened attachment systems which allow for\nthermal movement. In critical visual areas, the COP recommends a maximum unstiffened depth of 200 mm on the\nvertical face.\nMetal flashings must have a bend radius complying with the minimum radii prescribed in 4.10.8\nMicrocracking.\nThe minimum thickness for metal flashings must be:\nCoated steel - 0.55 mm,\nAluminium - 0.70 mm,\nCopper - 0.60 mm,\nZinc - 0.70 mm,\nStainless steel - 0.45 mm.\nProprietary EPDM penetration flashings are detailed in 9.5 Boot Flashings.\n8.1.1 \nFlashing Durability \nWhere a flashing is hidden or is otherwise difficult to access for maintenance or replacement, or it requires\ncladding to be removed to replace the flashing, it must have durability for the life of the building or not less than\n50 years. All flashings should be made from materials with a durability expectation not less than that of the\ncladding.\nIn some corrosive environments, stainless steel or non-ferrous metals should be used for flashings. All metals\nmust be checked for compatibility with the roof material. (See 4.9 Compatibility and 4.9.4A Interactive\nMaterial Compatibility Tool)\n 8 \n 8.1 FLASHING MATERIALS\n 1 \n 8 \n 8.1 \n220\nThis is a controlled document.

The pressure differential caused by wind gusting fluctuates\ngreatly, so a gap should be created behind the outer edge of a flashing to provide a pressure cushion. Longitudinal\nflashings are best designed with a pressure equalisation gap to balance varying pressures and prevent capillary\naction. (See 4.10.6 Capillary Action.)\nThe preferred maximum production length of flashing is 6-8 m, depending on profile strength. As any sealed lap\nsecured by rivets or screws effectively becomes one length, provide expansion joints where required. Flashings\nare similarly restricted in length as roof and wall cladding sheets and are subject to the same requirements and\nexpansion provisions. (See 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion Provisions.) Inadequate provision for flashing\nexpansion can also cause roof noise\nAvoid wet contact between the edges of flashings and concrete, plaster or butyl rubber (See 4.9\nCompatibility.) When notched flashings are used, the cut edge must not touch the pan, as that can cause\ncorrosion from abrasion.\n8.2A Notched Flashing\n2mm - 5mm \nclearance\nScrew to purlin\nCut tab and bend under\nNo Gap.

The void in between these\ntwo barriers acts as a pressure equalisation gap. \nSoft edging can be supplied in material compatible with the roofing material. This may be a naturally malleable\nmetal, or metal perforated to enable it to be shaped to the profile, see 17.3 MRM Soft Edge Standard.\nStop ends must be provided for all pitches in all wind zones\nIn extreme circumstances, a profiled or notched closure can be used between the stop end and the downturn or\nsoft edge. When closures or filler blocks are used, they must be adhered to the profile or secured by the cladding\nfasteners to ensure they remain in position.\nAdditional ventilation requirements must be considered when using profiled closures, see 10.10 Ventilation\nPathways.\n8.2.1A Hemmed Flashing\n 8 \n 8.2 FLASHING DESIGN\n 2 \n 8 \n 8.2 \n222\nThis is a controlled document.

Maximum dimension between folds should be\nrestricted to 300 mm where possible, or swages installed to stiffen the panel. Constructing such flashings from\nthicker material will also help prevent distortion, but availability of such may be subject to minimum order\nquantities. Edges should be clip-fastened to allow thermal movement, and lengths over 6 m should be installed\nwith a thermal expansion joint. This can be constructed as an overlap, or a negative detail with sheet ends\noverlapping an under-soaker, with a gap between the ends of the exposed faces. Typically, this gap would be\n5 mm for steel flashings, and 10 mm for aluminium. 8.5.3 Parapet Cappings shows an example of a parapet\ncap expansion detail.\n8.3A Buckling in Metal Fascia Due to Thermal Expansion\n 8 \n 8.3 METAL FASCIAS AND FACADES\n 3 \n 8 \n 8.3 \n225\nThis is a controlled document.

In such cases, a clearance of 20 mm\nis sufficient to prevent contamination and prolonged wetness of the cladding.\nThe 5 mm clearance to inter-storey junctions and window heads is not achievable when the horizontal flashing\nhas a slope of 15 deg . The clearance at the back of the flashing/roof pan should be minimal, 2 - 5 mm, and the slope\nof the flashing should be decreased to minimise the clearance at the rib crest. For vermin proofing, the maximum\nclearance at the rib should be 8 mm.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BC01 Clearance between sheet ends\nand transverse flashings.\nExtract:\n\"The Metal Roofing and Wall Cladding Code of Practice (COP) stipulates clearance should be provided\nbetween the bottom edge of a profiled sheet and a transverse flashing, such as a change of pitch\nflashing. The purpose of such clearance is to prevent the end of the profiled sheet from damaging the\nprotective coating on the flashing, due to movement of the former from thermal expansion...\"\n 8 \n 8.4 FLASHING COVER\n 8 \n 8.4 \n231\nThis is a controlled document.

The roll top or square top of a ridging helps accommodate expansion of the roof sheeting\nand strengthens the ridge.\nA vee ridge is not able to support walking traffic and is vulnerable to buckling caused by point\nload and lateral or longitudinal thermal movement.\nA soft-edged flashing can be used for corrugated and low rib trapezoidal profiles, and notched\nridging can be used on all trapezoidal, trough or standing seam profiles.\n8.5.1A Ridge-Hip Junction\n 8 \n 8.5 FLASHING TYPES\n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n233\nThis is a controlled document.

An under-flashing such as soft aluminium,underlay, or butyl flexible\nmemberane may be used as a secondary means of waterproofing; but with a tidily executed intersection these are\nnot necessary for weather-proofness.\nThe gable end termination of roll ridging must be made vermin proof by cutting the ridging back 25 mm and\nclosing it. \nAs an alternative to continuous ridging on ribbed profiled sheets, use individual rib or ridge caps fitted to each rib\nafter the ribs have been cut and the roof cladding bent over the ridge. Each cap should be accurately fitted and\nsealed. This method does not allow for free expansion at the ridge of long length roof cladding and restricts\nnatural ventilation of the ceiling cavity. These caps rely on sealant to be made watertight and are only\nrecommended for use at the apex of a roof and when there is sufficient ventilation.\n 8 \n 8.5 FLASHING TYPES\n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n234\nThis is a controlled document.

It should have a minimum clearance of 25 mm to allow for cleaning and maintenance.\nApron flashings should be in position before the cladding is installed. Where replacement of the flashing requires\nremoval of the cladding above it, Figure 1 and Table 1 of B2/AS1 require the flashing to have a durability of 50\nyears. Durability can be achieved by using flashings made from non-ferrous materials. Alternatively, a 8.5.4F\nTwo-piece Apron should be used where the over-flashing has 50-year durability, and the apron flashing can be\nrenewed independently.\nWhen the parapet walls will be plastered or when other trades are likely to follow the roof cladding installation,\nthe roof cladding, and flashings should be protected from damage. Provision should also be made for working\nand walking on the roof cladding during this time.\nWhere an apron abuts a block, brick, or concrete wall without any cladding above it, the apron flashing can be\nweathered by a step or a continuous chased flashing. These flashings can be made from aluminium, stainless\nsteel, or zinc when used with metallic-coated steels and should extend 25 mm into the wall. They should be\nhooked or mechanically wedged and should be sealed using a compatible, flexible mortar or sealant.

They can, however, serve a purpose in many\napplications of improving the durability of roofing at the eaves.\nThe flashing should extend into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the flashing. If there is\nno over flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm.\nUnwashed flashings should be made of durable materials such as organic coated steel, aluminium, or PVC.\nEaves flashings as referred to in E2/AS1 are not required for weatherproofing unless the eaves are unprotected by\nspouting, but they can make a contribution to durability.\nEaves flashings are recommended in Marine Environments to improve the durability of the roof cladding and are\nrequired for pre-painted aluminium roofs (see 14.9). Eaves flashings may be pre-painted steel or aluminium (either\npre-painted or uncoated). To minimise the build-up of salt deposits at the eaves, a high-fronted gutter fully\ncovering the roof crests, attached closely to the fascia, is recommended in Severe and Very Severe Marine\nenvironments.\n8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves Flashing Option 1\n50\n125\n 8 \n 8.5 FLASHING TYPES\n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n257\nThis is a controlled document.

Lock-seamed flashings are made in two parts, the\nhorizontal (part a) and the vertical (part b). Edges can be either crimped or lock-seamed, as shown in these\ndrawings.\n 8 \n 8.5 FLASHING TYPES\n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n258\nThis is a controlled document.

(See 14.21 Tools Of The Trade.) The outside edge can be crimped as\nshown here, or hemmed.\nShallowly curved flashings can be folded straight in one piece and crimped on both edges. Fix the turn-down at\nthe curved rib by \"mini-crimping\" or \"gear-crimping\". \n8.5.5.2 \nCrimped Flashings \nCrimped flashings are suitable for use on radii of more than 2 m, with the crimp spaced and deformed at regularly\nspaced intervals. A flat strip should be placed on the template and crimped until the strip fits the template.\nBecause the flashings are seen from much closer, domestic clients may find this type of flashing\naesthetically unacceptable.\n8.5.5.2A Regularly Spaced Crimp (Crimp Flashing)\n 8 \n 8.5 FLASHING TYPES\n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n259\nThis is a controlled document.

Primary fasteners are relied on for structural\nperformance. Flashings should be fastened at a point within 25 mm from the exposed edges of the flashing, and\nthe primary fastener spacing should be to each structural member it crosses.\nFlashings should be fixed on both edges.\nPutting bonded or embossed washers under all primary fasteners through the horizontal upper surface of\nflashings improves weathertightness.\n8.6.2 \nSecondary Fasteners \nSecondary fasteners are fixings that attach flashings to sheets and one another to transfer loads and provide lap\nsealing. Rivets and stitching screws are secondary fasteners used to fasten flashing laps. They are subject to\nshear loading due to expansion and differential movement.\nSealing washers are required on all secondary fasteners, except under rivets which should themselves be sealed\nor self-sealing.\n8.6.3 \nFlashing Cleats \nA flashing cleat is a continuous metal under-flashing installed behind the leading edge of a metal\ncapping or flashing. Cleats secure cladding or flashings to the substrate or structure using a slip\njoint or by crimping the leading edge of the flashing to the cleat.\nCleats and clips should be accurately aligned and clinched after fixing to avoid vibration or\nchatter, but should still allow for expansion of the flashing.\n 8 \n 8.6 FASTENING FLASHINGS\n 6 \n 8 \n 8.6 \n260\nThis is a controlled document.

They\nmay also have varying degrees of adhesive action.\nSealants are generally Neutral Cure silicone or Modified Silicone (MS) types. The latter is generally\npaintable. Proprietary self-adhesive tape sealants are also entering the market and give excellent\nperformance in certain conditions. Acid cure sealant, designed to bond to inert surfaces such as\nglass, must not be used.\nDesigns using sealants to seal sheet components must always include a mechanical fastening such as a\nscrew, rivet or a mechanical seam. \nGenerally, the function of a sealant is carried out by that sealant being sandwiched in the joint. In\nmost cases, the post application of sealant to the outside of a joint is both futile and unacceptable.\nThe sealant does not require significant total adhesive strength, but it should bond positively to\nboth surfaces as a continuous layer. To ensure complete sealant cure, the width of sealant in a lap\nshould not exceed 25 mm when compressed\n8.7.1 \nMethods Of Sealing \nThere are two main methods of sealing metal sheets - gun applied sealants and self-adhesive tapes.\nSealants should have a low resistance to compression so that metal sheets can be brought closely together by\ntheir fasteners and not held apart by the sealant.\n8.7.2 \nSurface Preparation \nFor adequate bonding, all surfaces must be clean, dry and free from contaminants, such as rolling oils, dirt or\ndust. \n8.7.3 \nSealant Extrusion And Placement \nSealant should be gun-applied in a continuous flow to provide a joint without gaps or voids. This will prevent the\nentry of both condensation from above and water drawn up by capillary action, either of which can cause metal\ncorrosion.\nAfter placing the sealant cartridge in the gun, the tapered nozzle should be cut with a sharp knife\nat an angle of 45 deg at a position which would provide a bead of sealant approximately 6 mm in\ndiameter.\n 8 \n 8.7 SEALANTS\n 7 \n 8 \n 8.7 \n264\nThis is a controlled document.

The stem holes of unsealed blind rivets must be sealed with silicone,\nwhich can attract dust and look unsightly.\nSealant should be placed in a continuous bead close to the weather end, covering any pre-drilled rivet holes. If a\ncomplete ring of sealant is applied around the fastener, an air pocket forms which compresses during tightening\nof fasteners. It can blow a channel, thus preventing an effective seal.\nThe best method for lap fabrication is.\nAssemble and drill the components. Rivets should be positioned at 50 mm spacings.\nSeparate the components and remove any drilling swarf.\nRemove any strippable film.\nClean the joint.\nApply a continuous sealant bead as described above.\nRelocate the components, align the holes and fasten.\nExternally seal the centre of all rivets if required.\nRemove surplus sealant after it has cured (not while uncured), to avoid smearing.\nWhen placing the overlapping sheet, care should be taken to avoid disturbing the sealant when fastening.\nExcess sealant should be removed with a plastic spatula or purpose made plastic scoop as excess sealant\ncollects dirt that is unsightly.\nVisible excess of sealant is not an acceptable trade practice.\n 8 \n 8.7 SEALANTS\n 7 \n 8 \n 8.7 \n265\nThis is a controlled document.

They are available in narrow tip (for going under the profile) or wide\ntip (for fitting over).\nA printable bulletin is available at: BPC01 Profiled Foam Closures.\nExtract:\n\"The NZMRM Metal Roof and Wall Cladding Code of Practice recommends profiled foam closures\nonly where required for weather tightness. This typically occurs around windows of wall cladding.\nAcceptable Solution E2/AS1 says profiled foam closures should not be used at the eaves.\"\nAs they restrict the free movement of air, their use should be restricted to where they are required for\nweatherproofing and appearance (such as scribers under window jamb flashings) or for maintaining positive\ninternal pressures, such as in building with a managed internal environment. Profiled closures should be of closed\ncell type, rather than bitumen impregnated.\nIn marine areas, corrosion is likely to initiate under apex flashings and under the eaves overhang, regardless of\nwhether profiled foam is used. A high fronted spouting is the best protection against the eaves corrosion. In very\nsevere cases, or where there is a gap between the back of the gutter and the fascia, an eaves flashing of durable\nmaterial (e.g., aluminium or plastic) can be used to prevent much of the salt build-up on the underside of the roof\ncladding.

Lead was the\ntraditional material for this application, but as it is incompatible with AZ coatings, soft aluminium edging or\nProprietary soft edging is available for corrugated and low trapezoidal profiles, consisting of an expandable\naluminium mesh with a flexible backer.\nAll soft-edged flashings should be primed and colour painted before installation - but the preferred option is for\nthe paint finish on soft edges to be factory painted under controlled conditions.\nSoft-edged flashings are available in a partially-backed form to facilitate passive ventilation at the apex. (See \nInternal Moisture)\n8.8.2 \nNotched Edging \nWhere the profile height exceeds 30 mm, a notched flashing is the preferred option.\nAll scribed edges should have clearance to avoid damaging the coating of the roof sheet. The scribed metal edge\nof any flashing must have a clearance of 2 mm to 5 mm.\n8.8G J-type Vermin Closure\nVented vermin strip\nMax 8mm gap\nFloor pad\nHorizontal \nCladding\nDPC\n8.8H L-type Vermin Closure\nmax 8mm gap\nCladding\nFloor pad\n3 - 5 mm gap or \nclosed cell tape\n 8 \n 8.8 PROFILE CLOSURES\n 8 \n 8 \n 8.8 \n269\nThis is a controlled document.

(Source: Rooflink)\nAbnormal growth causes this defect in timber, which can cause ten times more shrinkage than normal.\nIt is not easy to recognise compression timber visually and roofers are advised to measure the moisture content,\nparticularly of ridge purlins, before fixing. Framing timber must have a maximum moisture content of 12% before\nany transverse flashings are fixed.\nAlternatively, use steel top hat purlins.\n 8 \n 8.9 COMPRESSION TIMBER\n 9 \n 8 \n 8.9 \n271\nThis is a controlled document.

As flashings cannot move in the lateral direction without stress, they should\nhave some provision for longitudinal expansion when their length exceeds 18m or for lesser distances for visible\nflashings such as fascias and facades.\nWhen using an expansion joint, independence of movement should be assured by the omission of any fixing\nthrough both sides of the joint. Preferred and acceptable slip joint expansion details are shown in 8.10A Apron\nSlip-joint and 8.10B Ridge Slip-joint. Soaker expansion joints relying on sealant should not be used.\nSlip joints require sealants, not to make them weatherproof, but to exclude dust and dirt from two close-fitting\nsurfaces, which can retain moisture by capillary action and cause corrosion. Rivets and other fasteners must not\nprevent movement of the slip joint.\n8.10A Apron Slip-joint\n8.10B Ridge Slip-joint\n 8 \n 8.10 FLASHING EXPANSION DETAILS\n 10 \n 8 \n 8.10 \n272\nThis is a controlled document.

Abnormal growth causes this defect in timber, and it can shrink up to 10 times more than\nnormal. It is not easy to recognise compression timber, and roofers are advised to measure the moisture\ncontent, particularly of ridge purlins, before fixing.\nAn alternative is to use steel top hat purlins.\nFixing roof cladding should be treated in the same way as internal linings, i.e., do not fix transverse\nflashings when the moisture content of any timber is more than 18%. The thickness of flashings should\nalways comply as specified in 8.1 Flashing Materials\nIf flashings are positively fixed, framing timber that does not meet this requirement can cause\nfailure of ridging and flashings due to timber shrinkage when drying.\nThe metal expansion allowances quoted in many publications can be misleading because the\ninformation is based on theoretical metal expansion values and is not related to real-world\nconditions.\nFigures published for metal expansion rates are given linearly per degree, but it does not take into\naccount the many other factors that mitigate the theoretical figure. (See 7.3 Thermal Expansion\nAnd Contraction.) \nIt is necessary to make provision for cladding and flashing movement; when long lengths are used and positively\nscrewed or riveted together, they should be regarded as one length.\nThe maximum length before expansion provision should be made for either cladding or flashings will vary\naccording to colour, micro-climate, ventilation and fixing spacings. It is, however, possible to provide indicative\nfigures based on a study of empirical data over time. The maximum recommended flashing length without any\nexpansion provision is similar to that of roof cladding. (See 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion Provisions.)\nAluminium rivets, which have a low shear value, will fail when there is no provision made for expansion in flashing\nlengths of over 12 m. Using aluminium rivets is only acceptable if they are used at the prescribed distances, and\nare not used to replace expansion joints.\nLengths of coated steel ridging, cappings, and apron flashings over 12 m should have a slip joint as described in \n8.10 Flashing Expansion Details.\nInadequate provision for expansion can also cause roof noise.\n8.10.2 \nBuilding Expansion Joints \nExpansion joints should be designed to accommodate contraction and expansion. Expansion joints should be\ndetailed and constructed to a minimum height of 100 mm above the roof cladding, and curb-type expansion joints\nshould be designed and installed to ensure drainage of the roof and to prevent any damming of water.\n 8 \n 8.10 FLASHING EXPANSION DETAILS\n 10 \n 8 \n 8.10 \n273\nThis is a controlled document.

A 8.10.2A One-piece Expansion Joint to accommodate movement using a central bellows or roll that\nallows the flashing to be positively fixed on both sides.\n2. A two-piece design to accommodate movement by the use of hemmed edges, with sufficient clearance for the\nexpected movement.\n8.10.2A One-piece Expansion Joint\nOptional Bellows\n8.10.2B Two-piece Expansion Joint\nSealant\nBoth of these designs are shown as a parapet following the pitch of the roof. Where this is not the case, the top\nof flashing should have a 3 - 5 slope as for all other parapet flashings. (See 8.5.3 Parapet Cappings).\nMetal wall construction joint flashings that are embedded in the wall should be made with a bellows or other\nmeans of accommodating movement without fatigue and have a durability of 50 years.\n 8 \n 8.10 FLASHING EXPANSION DETAILS\n 10 \n 8 \n 8.10 \n274\nThis is a controlled document.

The pressure differential caused by wind gusting fluctuates\ngreatly, so a gap should be created behind the outer edge of a flashing to provide a pressure cushion. Longitudinal\nflashings are best designed with a pressure equalisation gap to balance varying pressures and prevent capillary\naction.

In such cases, a clearance of 20 mm\nis sufficient to prevent contamination and prolonged wetness of the cladding.\nThe 5 mm clearance to inter-storey junctions and window heads is not achievable when the horizontal flashing\nhas a slope of 15 deg . The clearance at the back of the flashing/roof pan should be minimal, 2 - 5 mm, and the slope\nof the flashing should be decreased to minimise the clearance at the rib crest. For vermin proofing, the maximum\nclearance at the rib should be 8 mm.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BC01 Clearance between sheet ends\nand transverse flashings.\nExtract:\n\"The Metal Roofing and Wall Cladding Code of Practice (COP) stipulates clearance should be provided\nbetween the bottom edge of a profiled sheet and a transverse flashing, such as a change of pitch\nflashing. The purpose of such clearance is to prevent the end of the profiled sheet from damaging the\nprotective coating on the flashing, due to movement of the former from thermal expansion...\"\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 8 \n 8.4 \n231\nThis is a controlled document.

The roll top or square top of a ridging helps accommodate expansion of the roof sheeting\nand strengthens the ridge.\nA vee ridge is not able to support walking traffic and is vulnerable to buckling caused by point\nload and lateral or longitudinal thermal movement.\nA soft-edged flashing can be used for corrugated and low rib trapezoidal profiles, and notched\nridging can be used on all trapezoidal, trough or standing seam profiles.\n8.5.1A Ridge-Hip Junction\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n233\nThis is a controlled document.

An under-flashing such as soft aluminium,underlay, or butyl flexible\nmemberane may be used as a secondary means of waterproofing; but with a tidily executed intersection these are\nnot necessary for weather-proofness.\nThe gable end termination of roll ridging must be made vermin proof by cutting the ridging back 25 mm and\nclosing it. \nAs an alternative to continuous ridging on ribbed profiled sheets, use individual rib or ridge caps fitted to each rib\nafter the ribs have been cut and the roof cladding bent over the ridge. Each cap should be accurately fitted and\nsealed. This method does not allow for free expansion at the ridge of long length roof cladding and restricts\nnatural ventilation of the ceiling cavity. These caps rely on sealant to be made watertight and are only\nrecommended for use at the apex of a roof and when there is sufficient ventilation.\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n234\nThis is a controlled document.

It should have a minimum clearance of 25 mm to allow for cleaning and maintenance.\nApron flashings should be in position before the cladding is installed. Where replacement of the flashing requires\nremoval of the cladding above it, Figure 1 and Table 1 of B2/AS1 require the flashing to have a durability of 50\nyears. Durability can be achieved by using flashings made from non-ferrous materials. Alternatively, a 8.5.4F\nTwo-piece Apron should be used where the over-flashing has 50-year durability, and the apron flashing can be\nrenewed independently.\nWhen the parapet walls will be plastered or when other trades are likely to follow the roof cladding installation,\nthe roof cladding, and flashings should be protected from damage. Provision should also be made for working\nand walking on the roof cladding during this time.\nWhere an apron abuts a block, brick, or concrete wall without any cladding above it, the apron flashing can be\nweathered by a step or a continuous chased flashing. These flashings can be made from aluminium, stainless\nsteel, or zinc when used with metallic-coated steels and should extend 25 mm into the wall. They should be\nhooked or mechanically wedged and should be sealed using a compatible, flexible mortar or sealant.

Eaves flashings may be pre-painted steel or aluminium (either\npre-painted or uncoated). To minimise the build-up of salt deposits at the eaves, a high-fronted gutter fully\ncovering the roof crests, attached closely to the fascia, is recommended in Severe and Very Severe Marine\nenvironments.\n8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves Flashing Option 1\n50\n125\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n257\nThis is a controlled document.

Lock-seamed flashings are made in two parts, the\nhorizontal (part a) and the vertical (part b). Edges can be either crimped or lock-seamed, as shown in these\ndrawings.\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n258\nThis is a controlled document.

(See 14.21 Tools Of The Trade.) The outside edge can be crimped as\nshown here, or hemmed.\nShallowly curved flashings can be folded straight in one piece and crimped on both edges. Fix the turn-down at\nthe curved rib by \"mini-crimping\" or \"gear-crimping\". \n8.5.5.2 \nCrimped Flashings \nCrimped flashings are suitable for use on radii of more than 2 m, with the crimp spaced and deformed at regularly\nspaced intervals. A flat strip should be placed on the template and crimped until the strip fits the template.\nBecause the flashings are seen from much closer, domestic clients may find this type of flashing\naesthetically unacceptable.\n8.5.5.2A Regularly Spaced Crimp (Crimp Flashing)\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 5 \n 8 \n 8.5 \n259\nThis is a controlled document.

Abnormal growth causes this defect in timber, and it can shrink up to 10 times more than\nnormal. It is not easy to recognise compression timber, and roofers are advised to measure the moisture\ncontent, particularly of ridge purlins, before fixing.\nAn alternative is to use steel top hat purlins.\nFixing roof cladding should be treated in the same way as internal linings, i.e., do not fix transverse\nflashings when the moisture content of any timber is more than 18%. The thickness of flashings should\nalways comply as specified in 8.1 Flashing Materials\nIf flashings are positively fixed, framing timber that does not meet this requirement can cause\nfailure of ridging and flashings due to timber shrinkage when drying.\nThe metal expansion allowances quoted in many publications can be misleading because the\ninformation is based on theoretical metal expansion values and is not related to real-world\nconditions.\nFigures published for metal expansion rates are given linearly per degree, but it does not take into\naccount the many other factors that mitigate the theoretical figure. (See 7.3 Thermal Expansion\nAnd Contraction.) \nIt is necessary to make provision for cladding and flashing movement; when long lengths are used and positively\nscrewed or riveted together, they should be regarded as one length.\nThe maximum length before expansion provision should be made for either cladding or flashings will vary\naccording to colour, micro-climate, ventilation and fixing spacings. It is, however, possible to provide indicative\nfigures based on a study of empirical data over time. The maximum recommended flashing length without any\nexpansion provision is similar to that of roof cladding. (See 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion Provisions.)\nAluminium rivets, which have a low shear value, will fail when there is no provision made for expansion in flashing\nlengths of over 12 m. Using aluminium rivets is only acceptable if they are used at the prescribed distances, and\nare not used to replace expansion joints.\nLengths of coated steel ridging, cappings, and apron flashings over 12 m should have a slip joint as described in \nInadequate provision for expansion can also cause roof noise.\n8.10.2 \nBuilding Expansion Joints \nExpansion joints should be designed to accommodate contraction and expansion. Expansion joints should be\ndetailed and constructed to a minimum height of 100 mm above the roof cladding, and curb-type expansion joints\nshould be designed and installed to ensure drainage of the roof and to prevent any damming of water.\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 10 \n 8 \n 8.10 \n273\nThis is a controlled document.

A 8.10.2A One-piece Expansion Joint to accommodate movement using a central bellows or roll that\nallows the flashing to be positively fixed on both sides.\n2. A two-piece design to accommodate movement by the use of hemmed edges, with sufficient clearance for the\nexpected movement.\n8.10.2A One-piece Expansion Joint\nOptional Bellows\n8.10.2B Two-piece Expansion Joint\nSealant\nBoth of these designs are shown as a parapet following the pitch of the roof. Where this is not the case, the top\nof flashing should have a 3 - 5 slope as for all other parapet flashings. (See 8.5.3 Parapet Cappings).\nMetal wall construction joint flashings that are embedded in the wall should be made with a bellows or other\nmeans of accommodating movement without fatigue and have a durability of 50 years.\n 8 EXTERNAL MOISTURE FLASHINGS\n 8 \n 10 \n 8 \n 8.10 \n274\nThis is a controlled document.

The type of penetration design is determined by:\nthe size of the hole,\nshape,\nthe roof pitch,\nthe type of roof,\nthe catchment area,\nplacement on the roof, and\naesthetic requirements.\nDesigners are urged to consider what type of penetration design matches the building application and their\ncustomer's needs, and detail accordingly, rather than allow the installer to make an on-site decision.\nSee it in action with Roofguide\nMany of the penetration details in the Code of Practice are expanded on with step-by-step, interactive 3D\ninstructions in the RANZ Roofing Guide, developed by the Roofing Association of New Zealand in\nassociation with the NZMRM.\nWorks on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.\n 9 \n 9 \n276\nThis is a controlled document.

(See 3.5.1.1 Continuity.)\nPenetrations requiring removal of a roof section greater than 300 mm x 300 mm require additional supporting\nframework. Ideally this should be in position before the roof cladding is fixed; alternatively, the supporting\nframework should be in position before cutting a hole in the cladding.\nThe additional support for larger penetrations must have the same strength as the adjacent purlins. Purlins and\nthe support structure must be designed to take the additional weight of any plant exceeding 100 kg. Structural\nmembers must not be removed without engineering calculations.\n9.2.1 \nPenetrations Safety \nThe person who cuts a hole greater than 600 mm x 600 mm in the roof is responsible for safety precautions,\npreventing workers from falling through the gap.

The number of rivets required can also be reduced by sealing the joints with Extra Heavy Duty double-\nsided tape. See 9.4.2.6F Cricket Under-Soaker: Trapezoidal.\nWider watershed flashings can be fabricated using longitudinal standing seam techniques on suitable support.\n9.4.1.1A Overflashed Backflashing\nSeal and fix over-flashing to back \ntray use VHB Tape or rivets at \n50mm centers.\nFall\nNotch apron\nFit over flashing\n100mm\nSeal and rivet\nForm hem to top\nover ribs\ncontinuous to ridge\nedge of soaker\nHigh density \npolystyrene installed \nin pans of roofing \nprofile to support tray \nflashing\nThe under flashing must be cut on an angle over the width of the lap to \nprevent debris being trapped and causing water to run up and over the rib.\nBack flashing\n 9 \n 9.4 PENETRATION DESIGN\n 9 \n 9.4 \n282\nThis is a controlled document.

They are\nrelatively easy and economical to install at the time of roof laying, but more difficult and costlier if post\ninstallation is required.\n9.4.2 \nCurb Design \nCurb design (i.e., level, arrowhead, or cricket) depends largely on the penetration width and the expected amount\nof debris, e.g., tree leaves. Proximity to the apex determines penetration flashing design (i.e., over flashing, under-\nsoaker, or hidden gutter).\n9.4.2.1 \nLevel Back Curbs \nLevel back curbs are the most common solution for flashing penetrations and are the easiest to fabricate and\ninstall.\nThey may tend to collect debris as they have little or no transverse fall, which can limit durability. However, with\nnormal maintenance when manufactured from the same material as the roof they should achieve the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC.\nFor penetrations wider than 600 mm, or those in aggressive environments or in situations where maintenance is\ndifficult, a freer draining design such as an arrowhead or cricket is preferable.\n9.4.2.2 \nArrowhead Back Curbs \nArrowhead back curbs have a diverter that provides transverse fall for diverting rainwater, enabling them to\naccommodate bigger catchment areas and self-cleanse. They have a small flat area at the base of the arrowhead\nthat may require maintenance.\n9.4.2.3 \nCricket Back Curbs \nCricket back curbs divert water with less turbulence than either arrowhead or flat back curbs and have no flat\nareas to catch debris. They may be fabricated from the same material as the roof or welded from 1.6 mm\naluminium and powder-coated to match the roof colour, to give a durable and matching solution. One-piece\nwelded flashings offer the most durable and weathertight solution to penetration back curb.\n 9 \n 9.4 PENETRATION DESIGN\n 9 \n 9.4 \n283\nThis is a controlled document.

The top is trimmed to form a tight weatherproof collar around the penetration, and the base is\nformed with a series of concentric rings to the underside and a malleable stiffener of aluminium which is dressed\nto conform to the shape of the roofing profile. It is generally top-fixed to the roof surface with screws or rivets,\nand sealant.\nThe Profiled Metal Roofing COP allows pipe penetration flashings to be fitted directly to the profile or on to an\nover flashing. Pitch limitations depend on the method used and the cladding profile.\nDirect-fixed options are pitch sensitive. When laid directly on to the profile at too low a pitch, they will entrap\nwater rather than allow it to discharge over the profile crests that they traverse. The practical limits of direct-fixed\nboot flashings that cross an entire pan are 8 deg for standard corrugated and 10 deg for low rib trapezoidal products.\nWhere the base of a boot does not obstruct a pan it can be direct-fixed to the minimum pitch for that profile.\nDirect fixed applications for high rib trapezoidal profiles and trough sections vary according to the profile, and the\nsize and position of the penetration. For these applications, the manufacturer should be consulted or the flashing\ncan be attached to an over flashing, or a top fixed soaker type can be used.\nWhere the penetration is wide such as a chimney flue casing, and the penetration is far from the apex, soaker\nflashings may be used where the profile ribs are cut back so water can divert into the adjacent pan.\nWhere overall width is not a constraint, directly fixed boot flashings should be installed with their edges diagonal\nto the fall of water. Where this is not practical, they may be laid square at pitches of 10 deg or more.\n9.5A Square-Fixed Over-Fitted Boot\nWhere boot flashings traverse a lap, the lap must be fully sealed or other actions must be taken to avoid leaks\nthrough capillary action. Where possible the fixing of a boot flashing over a lap should be avoided\nThe vertical sections of a boot flashing must not constrict the free flow of water. Where more than 50% blockage\nof the pan occurs other penetrations must be considered, or catchment calculations of the capacity of the\nremaining pan area should be made.

Typically, this is 8 deg for standard corrugated, and 3 deg for trapezoidal and trough sections. These boot\nflashings must be fixed diagonally to the fall of the roof at pitches below 10 deg .\nOver flashings can be continuous to the apex, or terminate with a soaker at the upper edge.\n 9 \n 9.5 BOOT FLASHINGS\n 5 \n 9 \n 9.5 \n298\nThis is a controlled document.

This procedure allows the\nE.P.D.M. flashings to be slid over the pipe framing during erection, and avoid the necessity of using retrofitting\ntypes.\nThe support framing should be in place, but below the top of the purlin, before installing the roof cladding.

Penetrations can be broadly put into two categories: Sheetmetal flashings and Boot\nflashings.\nThe positioning of the penetration in relation to the apex, eaves and other architectural features must be taken\ninto consideration when selecting the type of flashing to be employed.\n9.4A Recommended Penetration Type Positioning\nNarrow: \nLevel Back Kerb\nClose to Ridge:\nOverflashing\nDistant From Ridge:\nSoaker\nClose to Eave:\nHidden Gutter\nWide: Cricket \nBack Kerb\nMedium: \nArrowhead Back \nKerb\nSee it in action with Roofguide\nMany of the penetration details in the Code of Practice are expanded on with step-by-step, interactive 3D\ninstructions in the RANZ Roofing Guide, developed by the Roofing Association of New Zealand in\nassociation with the NZMRM.\nWorks on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.\nFind out more at www.roofguide.co.nz\n9.4.1 \nPenetration Back Flashings \n 9 EXTERNAL MOISTURE PENETRATIONS\n 9 \n 9 \n 9.4 \n281\nThis is a controlled document.

The number of rivets required can also be reduced by sealing the joints with Extra Heavy Duty double-\nsided tape. See 9.4.2.6F Cricket Under-Soaker: Trapezoidal.\nWider watershed flashings can be fabricated using longitudinal standing seam techniques on suitable support.\n9.4.1.1A Overflashed Backflashing\nSeal and fix over-flashing to back \ntray use VHB Tape or rivets at \n50mm centers.\nFall\nNotch apron\nFit over flashing\n100mm\nSeal and rivet\nForm hem to top\nover ribs\ncontinuous to ridge\nedge of soaker\nHigh density \npolystyrene installed \nin pans of roofing \nprofile to support tray \nflashing\nThe under flashing must be cut on an angle over the width of the lap to \nprevent debris being trapped and causing water to run up and over the rib.\nBack flashing\n 9 EXTERNAL MOISTURE PENETRATIONS\n 9 \n 9 \n 9.4 \n282\nThis is a controlled document.

They are\nrelatively easy and economical to install at the time of roof laying, but more difficult and costlier if post\ninstallation is required.\n9.4.2 \nCurb Design \nCurb design (i.e., level, arrowhead, or cricket) depends largely on the penetration width and the expected amount\nof debris, e.g., tree leaves. Proximity to the apex determines penetration flashing design (i.e., over flashing, under-\nsoaker, or hidden gutter).\n9.4.2.1 \nLevel Back Curbs \nLevel back curbs are the most common solution for flashing penetrations and are the easiest to fabricate and\ninstall.\nThey may tend to collect debris as they have little or no transverse fall, which can limit durability. However, with\nnormal maintenance when manufactured from the same material as the roof they should achieve the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC.\nFor penetrations wider than 600 mm, or those in aggressive environments or in situations where maintenance is\ndifficult, a freer draining design such as an arrowhead or cricket is preferable.\n9.4.2.2 \nArrowhead Back Curbs \nArrowhead back curbs have a diverter that provides transverse fall for diverting rainwater, enabling them to\naccommodate bigger catchment areas and self-cleanse. They have a small flat area at the base of the arrowhead\nthat may require maintenance.\n9.4.2.3 \nCricket Back Curbs \nCricket back curbs divert water with less turbulence than either arrowhead or flat back curbs and have no flat\nareas to catch debris.

Proximity to the apex determines penetration flashing design (i.e., over flashing, under-\nsoaker, or hidden gutter).\n9.4.2.1 \nLevel Back Curbs \nLevel back curbs are the most common solution for flashing penetrations and are the easiest to fabricate and\ninstall.\nThey may tend to collect debris as they have little or no transverse fall, which can limit durability. However, with\nnormal maintenance when manufactured from the same material as the roof they should achieve the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC.\nFor penetrations wider than 600 mm, or those in aggressive environments or in situations where maintenance is\ndifficult, a freer draining design such as an arrowhead or cricket is preferable.\n9.4.2.2 \nArrowhead Back Curbs \nArrowhead back curbs have a diverter that provides transverse fall for diverting rainwater, enabling them to\naccommodate bigger catchment areas and self-cleanse. They have a small flat area at the base of the arrowhead\nthat may require maintenance.\n9.4.2.3 \nCricket Back Curbs \nCricket back curbs divert water with less turbulence than either arrowhead or flat back curbs and have no flat\nareas to catch debris. They may be fabricated from the same material as the roof or welded from 1.6 mm\naluminium and powder-coated to match the roof colour, to give a durable and matching solution.

        "content": "9.5 \nBoot Flashings \nA boot flashing is a proprietary EPDM flashing designed to weatherproof cylindrical penetrations protruding from\na roof or wall. The top is trimmed to form a tight weatherproof collar around the penetration, and the base is\nformed with a series of concentric rings to the underside and a malleable stiffener of aluminium which is dressed\nto conform to the shape of the roofing profile. It is generally top-fixed to the roof surface with screws or rivets,\nand sealant.\nThe Profiled Metal Roofing COP allows pipe penetration flashings to be fitted directly to the profile or on to an\nover flashing. Pitch limitations depend on the method used and the cladding profile.\nDirect-fixed options are pitch sensitive. When laid directly on to the profile at too low a pitch, they will entrap\nwater rather than allow it to discharge over the profile crests that they traverse. The practical limits of direct-fixed\nboot flashings that cross an entire pan are 8 deg for standard corrugated and 10 deg for low rib trapezoidal products.\nWhere the base of a boot does not obstruct a pan it can be direct-fixed to the minimum pitch for that profile.\nDirect fixed applications for high rib trapezoidal profiles and trough sections vary according to the profile, and the\nsize and position of the penetration. For these applications, the manufacturer should be consulted or the flashing\ncan be attached to an over flashing, or a top fixed soaker type can be used.\nWhere the penetration is wide such as a chimney flue casing, and the penetration is far from the apex, soaker\nflashings may be used where the profile ribs are cut back so water can divert into the adjacent pan.\nWhere overall width is not a constraint, directly fixed boot flashings should be installed with their edges diagonal\nto the fall of water. Where this is not practical, they may be laid square at pitches of 10 deg or more.\n9.5A Square-Fixed Over-Fitted Boot\nWhere boot flashings traverse a lap, the lap must be fully sealed or other actions must be taken to avoid leaks\nthrough capillary action. Where possible the fixing of a boot flashing over a lap should be avoided\nThe vertical sections of a boot flashing must not constrict the free flow of water. Where more than 50% blockage\nof the pan occurs other penetrations must be considered, or catchment calculations of the capacity of the\nremaining pan area should be made.

This procedure allows the\nE.P.D.M. flashings to be slid over the pipe framing during erection, and avoid the necessity of using retrofitting\ntypes.\nThe support framing should be in place, but below the top of the purlin, before installing the roof cladding.

    "content": "10 \nInternal Moisture \nThe science of internal moisture control is concerned with the need to manage and control condensation, mould\ngrowth, and corrosion. \nThe outdoor environment, the building design, and occupant behaviour affect humidity in the living spaces, which\nultimately affects humidity in the ceiling space. \nThis section of the COP focusses predominantly on managing humidity in the ceiling space of dwellings. Shorter\nsections also cover the design of non-residential roof and wall cladding, which may also be affected by excessive\ninternal moisture. \n 10 \n 10 \n304\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n10.1 \nNZBC Clause E3: Internal Moisture (Extract) \nSource: Acceptable Solutions and Verifications for New Zealand Building Clause E3 Internal moisture.\n10.1.1 \nE3 Objective \nSafeguard people against illness, injury, or loss of amenity that could result from the accumulation of internal\nmoisture.\n10.1.2 \nE3 Functional Requirements \nBuildings must be constructed in a way to avoid the likelihood of:\nfungal growth on linings and other building elements, and\ndamage to building elements due to the presence of moisture.\n10.1.3 \nE3 Performance Requirements \nNZBC Clause E3 requires building practices to ensure an adequate combination of thermal resistance,\nventilation, and space temperature in all habitable spaces, bathrooms, laundries, and other spaces where\nmoisture may be generated or accumulate.\n10.1.4 \nCompliance \nNew Zealand Building Code clause E3.3 a) requires buildings to be constructed to avoid the likelihood of fungal\ngrowth on linings and other building elements. Acceptable Solution E3/AS1 1.0.1 says fungal growth can be\navoided by minimising internal condensation. While it gives no prescriptive solutions for achieving this, it has\nbeen shown that venting ceiling spaces has a significant effect not only in minimising the growth of mould in\nceiling spaces and ceilings, but also improves the air quality within the occupied spaces of a dwelling.\nIncreased levels of ceiling insulation results in less heat escape into the ceiling cavity. This lowers the\ntemperature of the ceiling cavity, which lowers the dew point, increasing the frequency and severity of\ncondensation. This can not only cause problems with mould growth and occupant health, but excess moisture\ncan also affect the durability of the roof and the structure.\n 10 \n 10.1 NZBC CLAUSE E3: INTERNAL MOISTURE (EXTRACT)\n 1 \n 10 \n 10.1 \n305\nThis is a controlled document.

This is particularly relevant to dwellings with\nconcrete floors or party walls which will exude moisture for extended periods during the curing process.\nThe COP requires details that enable free passage of air from eaves to ridge of all roofs of dwellings and requires\nspecial ventilation design for:\nflat roofs,\nsarked roofs,\nskillion roofs,\nbarrel curved and prickle-ridged roofs, and\nroofs with ceilings which allow easy passage of moisture vapour.\nLong (over 12 m spans), shallow-pitched (less than 12 deg ) roofs should also be designed to allow natural\nventilation.\nGenerally, there is no need to make provision for moisture control in industrial and most commercial buildings\ndue to them being either well-ventilated or climate-controlled. In buildings with valuable or delicate stock, the\npossibility of dripping condensation needs to be assessed.\n10.1.4A Mould Caused by Excess\nMoisture\n10.1.4B Durability Issues Due to Excess\nMoisture\n 10 \n 10.1 NZBC CLAUSE E3: INTERNAL MOISTURE (EXTRACT)\n 1 \n 10 \n 10.1 \n306\nThis is a controlled document.

Mould was worst in rental accommodation, where much of our most vulnerable population live.\nIn addition to the health effects, excessive internal moisture impacts material durability. In the roof space, this\ncan affect the roof cladding, underlay, purlins, trusses, fasteners, and seriously affect the durability and structural\nintegrity of those components without being apparent to the occupants.\n 10 \n 10.2 WHY MANAGE INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 2 \n 10 \n 10.2 \n308\nThis is a controlled document.

Problems arise in ceiling spaces when more water vapour enters than exits, and materials\nstay wet for long periods, or where standing water accumulates.\nThe primary purpose of roof cladding is to act as a rain screen so that no water enters the building from the\noutside. It is, however, equally important to ensure that the building is kept dry from inside. Because metal is a\ngood heat conductor and is not absorbent, condensation forms on metal cladding under conditions of high\nhumidity when surface temperatures drop below the dew point.\nThe solutions in the Code of Practice apply to cold roofs, where there is a gap between the ceiling insulation and\nthe roofing material. 10.12.2 Warm Roofs require specific design to avoid internal moisture problems. They are\ndiscussed in more detail under 15.5 Warm Roofs.\n 10 \n 10.4 CONDENSATION\n 10 \n 10.4 \n310\nThis is a controlled document.

Many of these changes have been led by the desire to\nincrease energy efficiency. Other building changes include unsealed downlights, which can allow ready entry of\nwater vapour into the ceiling space, and the demise of the open fireplace which provided considerable ventilation\nto the living areas of a home.\nOccupant behaviour has also changed. More families shower daily and then leave the house unoccupied and\nclosed-up for much of the day and night. Less activity means a low level of air changes per hour.\nThese changes can lead to internal moisture problems. As water vapour is lighter than other atmospheric gases,\nmuch of the moisture tends to migrate upwards into the ceiling cavity.\n 10 \n 10.5 BUILDING AIRTIGHTNESS\n 5 \n 10 \n 10.5 \n311\nThis is a controlled document.

Ceiling insulation excludes more heat from the ceiling cavity, resulting in\ncolder cavity air temperatures. Warmer air can hold more water vapour than cold air. Therefore, colder\ntemperatures in the ceiling cavity lead to an increased risk of condensation.\n10.6.1 \nInsulation Position \nInsulation must be positioned so that there is a gap of at least 20 mm between insulation and roofing. On flat\nceilings, or buildings without eaves, it must be placed so the gap is maintained at the eaves or an eaves\ninsulation barrier should be fitted. To achieve this, an eaves insulation barrier may be required.\n10.6.2 \nOther Insulation \nReflective foils are not defined as insulating, because they are only somewhat effective against radiative heat\nloss and have little impact on conductive and convective mechanisms. They also increase the potential for\nelectrocution. As they are non-absorbent, they are not permitted as residential roofing underlay in New Zealand.\nWhen Polyester blanket insulation is used in conjunction with metal roof cladding, special roofing screws should\nbe used to avoid binding.\nComposite insulated metal panels are described in 15.5 Warm Roofs.\nInsulation must not be laid over the purlins as this compromises the air gap and the efficiency of the insulation\nwhere the roofing compresses it.\n 10 \n 10.6 INSULATION\n 6 \n 10 \n 10.6 \n313\nThis is a controlled document.

Compared to much of the world - where 70% relative humidity is considered the\nthreshold of corrosion and health problems - New Zealand has very high humidity, particularly in northern\nregions, where the mean annual humidity levels are often around 80% or more. This means the dew point\n(temperature at which condensation begins to form) is also higher than in colder but drier climates.\nThe design requirements to deal with this environment are specific to New Zealand, which is reflected in our\nbuilding practices. It is not advisable to use design or installation practices from countries with different\nenvironmental conditions without a comprehensive assessment of the management of internal moisture under\nNZ conditions.\n10.7.1 \nHumidity \nRelative humidity (RH, given in per cent [%]), is the most widely known method: It gives the content of water\nvapour in the air relative to the maximum amount of water this parcel of air can hold at its present temperature.\nOther measures are absolute humidity and water vapour pressure.\n 10 \n 10.7 CLIMATE\n 7 \n 10 \n 10.7 \n314\nThis is a controlled document.

Therefore, the air inside in a building\ntypically has a higher moisture content than the external atmosphere.\nBathing and showering, cooking, heating, indoor laundries, and unvented clothes drying are the most obvious\nsources of water; respiration, perspiration, indoor plants, and pets also produce moisture.\nAreas for moisture-generating activities should be well ventilated and the entire building should be mechanically\nventilated to outside the structure. Proposed changes to NZBC G4/AS1 will require venting to the outside of\nappliances such as showers, baths, and cooktops.\n10.8.1A Everyday Activities Release\nMoisture Vapour\n10.8.1B Approximate Amount of Water\nVapour from Occupant Behaviour\nOccupant\nbehaviour\nEstimated Amount of Water\nReleased (per 2.5\ninhabitants)\nCooking\n(unventilated)\n3.0 L / day.\nBaths / Showers\n1.5 L/day. \nClothes Washing\n0.5 L/ day.\nClothes drying\n(unvented)\n5.0 L/ load.\nDishwashing\n1.0 L / day.\nPortable gas\nheater\nup to 1.6 litres per 1kg of gas\nburned.\nBreathing \n(average)\n3 litres per day.\nBreathing asleep\n(per hour)\n(average)\n50 ml.\nPerspiration \n0.5 litre per day.\nPot Plants\nThe same amount as the\ninput\n 10 \n 10.8 MOISTURE SOURCES\n 8 \n 10 \n 10.8 \n315\nThis is a controlled document.

Burning 1 kg of gas can release 1.6 litres of moisture into the atmosphere.\n10.8.3 \nMechanical Venting \nSupply-driven and exhaust-driven mechanical ventilation systems can pressurise or depressurise internal\natmospheres in different areas of the building. Supply-driven systems can be problematic as increased internal\npressures can drive moist air into the attic through openings in the ceiling.\nExhaust-driven systems can de-pressurise internal areas and increase the intake of moist external air, e.g. ground\nmoisture via a vented cavity. Unbalanced mechanical ventilation can also encourage moisture migration by\ncreating negative pressures in the ceiling cavity. These systems need to be well designed and maintained to avoid\nthe risk of affecting internal moisture. A balanced mechanical ventilation system, where both intake and exhaust\nare connected to the outside, is the preferred system and will be most effective when the thermal envelope of the\nbuilding is airtight.\n10.8.4 \nConstruction Moisture \nDuring construction, timber can become wet and take some time to dry out. Some activities, such as plastering\nand painting, also release water vapour.\nConcrete floors are particularly prolific sources of moisture. During curing, a 100 mm thick concrete slab\nreleases approximately 10 litres of water vapour per square metre of surface area. The curing period depends on\nvarious factors, but as a rule of thumb, a concrete floor cures at a depth-rate of 25 mm per month. Therefore, a\nconcrete slab can affect internal moisture levels for a considerable period.\nAll new buildings, particularly those with concrete floors, must be kept well ventilated (at much higher levels than\nrequired during normal use) until moisture levels of construction materials have stabilised.\n 10 \n 10.8 MOISTURE SOURCES\n 8 \n 10 \n 10.8 \n316\nThis is a controlled document.

The cavity should be constructed to prevent the migration of water vapour into the ceiling space. Wet\nsubfloors can be isolated by laying polythene tightly over the surface and taping all joints. More information can\nbe obtained from the Good Repair Guide: Damp Subfloors (BRANZ).\nConcrete floors must be installed over a damp-proof membrane (DPM) to ensure that moisture from within the\nground does not penetrate the slab. This membrane can be formed by a polyethene sheet that is taped at the laps\nand laid over compacted hard fill topped by a sand blinding layer. The DPM must be installed under the full extent\nof the slab, under any internal or perimeter foundations, extend up to the external edge of the floor slab, and\nlapped and sealed under the wall damp-proofing system.\n 10 \n 10.8 MOISTURE SOURCES\n 8 \n 10 \n 10.8 \n317\nThis is a controlled document.

The second line is preventing excessive amounts of moisture entering the ceiling cavity. It is\nrecommended that all ceilings are square stopped and all penetrations (cables, pipes, hatches, etc.) are caulked.\nOnly use downlights that are airtight and have a gasket\nA gloss painted plasterboard ceiling presents some resistance to the passage of water vapour but is not a\ncomplete barrier. Vapour will also find its way through any minor gaps in architectural details, and it is air\ntransport through gaps that is responsible for 95% of the passage of water vapour into the ceiling space.\nCeiling tiles and tongue and groove ceilings are considerably more porous than plasterboard. Unsealed\ndownlights can be a major source of moisture movement into the ceiling cavity and should be avoided where\npossible.\nSee BRANZ Facts Roof Ventilation #3 .\nIn some older New Zealand homes, vapour barriers have been used to limit entry of moist air into the ceiling\nspace, but control of air movement into the cavity and removal of damp air by ventilation is a more practical\napproach.\nCavity systems prescribed under E2AS1 9.1.8.1, except those behind masonry veneer, are classified as drained\nnot ventilated. That means they must be closed at the top to restrict air movement between the cavity and the\nroof space. Closing a cavity off at the top still allows reasonable ventilation of the cavity while preventing\nexcessive amounts of moisture rising to the ceiling space. Alternatively, wall cavities can be vented externally.\n 10 \n 10.9 MINIMISING INGRESS OF WATER VAPOUR INTO THE CEILING\nCAVITY\n 9 \n 10 \n 10.9 \n318\nThis is a controlled document.

The space may also be colder than the ambient air at\nnight due to 10.12.3 Night Sky Radiation\nWarm air naturally rises but has little tendency to move laterally, except when a strong wind blows into roof vents\nor causes substantial differences in air pressure on opposite sides of the building. That is why eave-to-ridge\nventilation is more effective under typical conditions than side-to-side ventilation.\nVentilation of a cavity space is desired to reduce the accumulation of condensation and assist in removing\nexcess heat. Natural ventilation via the ribs of metal roof and wall cladding can achieve this adequately in normal\ncircumstances, but additional provisions are often necessary. In all cases, air must flow naturally through the\nprofile crests without barriers such as profiled foam filler strips at the eaves and apex, or impingement of bulk\ninsulation.\n10.10A Ventilation pathway: Eaves\nwith Underlay\nVentilation Path\n10.10B Ventilation pathway: Eaves with\nFleece\nFleece-lined\nVentilation pathway\n 10 \n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS\n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n319\nThis is a controlled document.

This is not always\nnecessary, or even desirable...\"\nSimple techniques to provide a clear path for air to enter, travel along and exit the roof cavity can include:\nEaves:\nAllow air entry by soffit vents, over-fascia or behind-fascia vents, or by using fleece-lined roofing material.\nEnsuring that insulation does not impinge on the underside of the roof at the eaves. This can be achieved by\nusing a heeled truss, eaves baffle, or both.\nBody:\nEnsuring that the air can travel under the roof. If insulation is flush with the underside of the purlins it can\nbe done using a vented batten between the purlin and the underlay, or by using fleece lined roofing material.\nApex:\nMaking the roof underlay discontinuous at the apex by cutting or slitting the underlay and using a vented\nsoft edge or vented ridge.\nSarked roofs must have a gap in the sarking at eaves and apex, or by an alternative eaves-to-apex passage.\nWith skillion roof or flat roof construction, the air volume is significantly reduced, so moisture saturation levels\nare more quickly reached. Also with these roof types, air flow paths are more easily obstructed. In skillion roofs\nwith tongue and groove ceilings, a layer of roof underlay immediately above the ceiling will provide a vapour\ncheck and air barrier to compensate for the porosity of the ceiling. For more advice on skillion roof ventilation,\nsee https://www.branz.co.nz/pubs/branz-facts/roof-ventilation/4-skillion-roofs/\nRoofs continuous over an apex, such as barrel curved roofs or roofs with prickled ridges, must have adequate\nventilation to prevent the accumulation of moisture at the apex.\nLong low-pitched roofs will benefit from increased ventilation which may also assist in minimising thermally\ninduced expansion noise. Ventilation typically increases as the roof pitch increases. Air movement through the\ncrests depends on the spacing and area of the crests, roof pitch, and overall length of the sheeting. Corrugate and\ntrapezoidal roofing provide more ventilation than secret-fix roofing. Ventilation through the crests still depends\non air being allowed to enter at the eaves and escape at the apex.\nTrough or tray section roofs have smaller ventilation channels and may require additional ventilation.\nThe use of profiled closures at eaves or ridge will create a substantial air barrier, and alternative ventilation paths\nmust be created.\nAdditional roof space ventilation may take the form of:\nlouvre vents in gable-ends,\nsoffit vents,\nproprietary ridge vents,\nventilated soft edge strips on transverse flashings, or\nmechanical or wind-powered vents positioned close to the apex.\n 10 \n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS\n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n321\nThis is a controlled document.

More air escaping at the ridge than entering at the eaves can lower the pressure of the\nattic cavity and encourage more ingress of moist air from the dwelling area.\nIn pitches of 30 deg or less cross venting from eaves to eaves alone is generally enough when combined with natural\npassive ventilation at the apex.\nA common rule of thumb is to have a total ventilation cross-section area equal to 1/300 of the ceiling area. In NZ\nbuildings, much smaller ratios have proven sufficient in most cases.\nIncreasing roof space ventilation above the insulation has only a small effect on R values. Ventilation of spaces\nabove bulk insulation is not only desirable but prevents insulation losing effectiveness due to absorbing\nmoisture.\nPartial filling of a ceiling cavity with bulk insulation in flat roofs can severely reduce the amount of free air\navailable to absorb incoming water vapour, thereby increasing saturation levels. Adding insulation while re-roofing\nmust be done with due consideration; unless the amount of ventilation of the cavity is increased or a vapour\ncheck layer is used below the insulation, internal moisture problems can occur.\n10.10.1 \nMethods of Ventilation \nThe primary purpose of ventilation is to replace the moist air in the ceiling cavity with drier air from outdoors.\nAs warm, wet air tends to rise, a vent placed in the soffit or at the lower end of a roof will normally operate as an\nintake vent and a vent at the apex as an exhaust vent, but wind direction can reverse this relationship. Gable-end\nvents or vents aligned horizontally will act as an intake or exhaust depending on the wind direction.\n10.10.1.1 \nSoffit Vents \nSoffit vents can be made in a range of styles to suit the application. As wind pressure differentials are highest at\nthe eaves, they are an efficient ventilation solution and they are also very weather resistant. Soffit vents should\nalways be installed to allow free movement of air into the cavity and should not be blocked on the interior side by\ninsulation or other material.\n 10 \n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS\n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n322\nThis is a controlled document.

Fascia vents should be\nused in conjunction with a high fronted spouting so that the ends of the sheet and the vent are not exposed to\ndriven rain.\n10.10.1.3 \nRidge Vents \nRidge vents, such as continuous or intermittent ridge vents or vented head apron flashings, should always be used\nin conjunction with intake vents at a lower level.\nTo prevent creating negative pressures which can draw more moist internal air into the ceiling space, the free\nsurface area of ridge vents should always be less than that of eaves vents.\nSaturated water vapour can enter the building when commercial ridge vents are subjected to negative pressures\nor at times of high humidity associated with mist or fog. Such water vapour can form condensation on the\nstructural framework and appear as a leak. Ridge vents without adequate intake vents can also lead to leakage.\n 10 \n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS\n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n323\nThis is a controlled document.

The latter is more\ncommon. The PIB rubber, when dressed down on a hot day, can adhere to the roofing surface and prevent the\nescape of air at the apex. By removing all or most of the PIB backing this is avoided, and the perforations in the\naluminium become an effective pathway for trickle ventilation, while still being an effective baffle against wind-\nblown moisture.

This creates a low-pressure area, so they draw air\nfrom the ventilated area at a greater rate than stationary vents. The amount of air movement can be dampened\nbut is normally uncontrolled; it is developed as a function of wind speed as well as turbine size and efficiency.\nTurbine vents, unlike commercial ridge vents, are unaffected by wind direction and they are less prone to leaking.\n10.10.2 \nBattens \nBattens may be required to create a separation space between the roofing and the underlay. In some applications,\nthey may need to be ventilated to achieve sufficient airflow.\nThe type and number of fixings required to fix the counter battens to the roof structure must meet the design wind\nload, or the roof fasteners should be long enough to achieve the required penetration into the purlin below.\nBattens or counter battens, if not fixed by extended cladding fasteners, can be fixed using countersunk purlin\nscrews or if fixed with hex headed screws, they should be counter-bored before installation to avoid damage to\nthe roof cladding.\nSteel top hat, C or Z sections are also used as counter battens but require an additional insulating spacer to\navoid thermal bridging.\n 10 \n 10.10 VENTILATION PATHWAYS\n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n325\nThis is a controlled document.

By removing the separate layer of underlay, every crest becomes a\npathway for ventilation. On a gable roof, this will approximately double the air changes in a roof over conventional\nconstruction, without the height disruption, cost, or inconvenience of a ventilated batten.\nAnother advantage of these products is that they greatly increase speed of lay of a roof, and avoid delays due to\nexcessive wind.

Containment is normally achieved by using an absorbent roofing underlay. It is\nthe role of roofing underlay to absorb moisture temporarily and then release it back into the atmosphere.\nA printable bulletin about installing underlay when reroofing is\navailable at: BU01 Double laying of Underlay on Re-roof\nExtract:\n\"...we recommend that no more than a single layer of compliant underlay (laps\nexcluded) is present on a profiled metal roof.\"\nA common misconception holds that the roofing underlay acts as a drainage plane, channelling condensation\nfrom the underside of the metal roof to the gutter. In practice, most of the condensation forms on the underside\nof the underlay. Although roofing underlays are permeable, they still form a substantial vapour check, and as they\nare in contact with the roof, they are at a similar temperature. Any condensation that does form on the underside\nof the roof and falls onto the underlay generally only tracks down the underlay as far as the next purlin, where it is\ntrapped and absorbed by the underlay. Underlay is also affected by holes from roofing fasteners, making it\nunreliable as a \"second roof\".\nAs it is designed to execute its primary purpose of aiding in the management of internal moisture, underlay\nshould not be used as a compensation for unreliable weatherproofing design and installation\n10.11A Roof Cavity Condensation\nSmall Space:Condensation on \nunderside of cladding;often not muc\nbecause of small air volume.\nCondensation on top can be large \nwhen air is moist and calm.\nPermeable underlay in contact with \ncladding gets cold.

Not only the underlay will be saturated, but so will the ceiling structural\nmembers and insulation; mould, corrosion, and decay are inevitable. The cure is to decrease the amount of\nmoisture entering the ceiling cavity or increase ventilation of the ceiling space.\n10.11C Chronic Condensation \nChronic condensation problem caused by induction of moist air into the ceiling cavity. Although the underlay here\nis doing a good job of containing the surface water, the timber trusses, insulation, and ceiling below the underlay\nwere saturated with water.\nUnderlay also acts as a partial air barrier. (Rigid air barriers are also available.) Water will generally only go where\ngravity or air pressure takes it. By effectively reducing the space behind cladding, the underlay allows rapid\npressure equalisation on each side of the cladding, thereby reducing the ability of water to enter the space.\n10.11.1 \nUnderlay Standards \n 10 \n 10.11 UNDERLAY\n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n328\nThis is a controlled document.

Refer NZBC C/AS3-AS6, clause 4.17.8 \nUnderlays designated as self-supporting can be laid without support at spans up to 1.2 m.\nOther requirements for underlays vary for different cladding systems, but the important features of absorbency,\npermeability, water resistance, tensile strength, edge tear resistance, PH, and durability are important to comply\nwith the requirements of the NZBC.\nThe Code of Practice recommends synthetic self-supporting fire-retardant underlays for residential roofing\napplications.\n10.11.3 \nTypes Of Underlay \nApart from their fire retardance and ability to self-support, underlays are classified according to their absorbency\nand permeability.\nPermeable and Absorbent:\nKraft paper-based - bitumen impregnated paper\nSynthetic - 2 or 3 layers, using permeable synthetic film strengthened by sandwiched non-woven fabric.\nPermeable, non-absorbent:\nSynthetic permeable non-absorbent underlays are mainly used as wall wrap inside a drained cavity or with\ndirect fixed absorbent claddings.\nNon-Permeable, non-absorbent:\nfoil - Reflective aluminium foil over a flexible substrate. These can be either double-sided or white-faced.\n10.11.4 \nUnderlay Usage \nIn lined buildings and dwellings, an absorbent permeable underlay is required under metal roofs. The same applies\nto direct-fixed steel wall cladding, but underlays used behind a drained cavity are not required to be absorbent.\nFor aesthetic reasons, a foil-faced (or white-faced) vapour check layer may be used in unlined commercial or\nindustrial applications to reduce heat radiation from the roof cladding and provide enhancement of light. For\ninsulated applications, foil is normally used as a vapour check under the insulation and an absorbent permeable\nunderlay used above with a 20 mm gap from the roof cladding.\nOn non-residential dwellings, profiled roof-light sheeting running in continuous lengths from the ridge can have\nmultiple skins to avoid condensation dripping from the sheeting or plastic sheet with a spacer can be used to\nlessen condensation. Roof underlays should not be laid continuously under translucent roof or wall cladding.\n10.11.5 \nUnderlay Durability \n 10 \n 10.11 UNDERLAY\n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n330\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nNZBC Clause B2.3.1 requires non-structural building elements and those that are moderately difficult to replace\nto have a durability of 15 years, or, if difficult to replace, to have the same durability as the more durable elements\nof a system. Alternatively, the design should allow the replacement of the less durable elements without\nremoving the more durable components.\nCompliance with NZBC B2, therefore, requires roofing underlay to have durability equal to that of the roof\ncladding and no less than 15 years.\nWhen finishing on an eaves flashing the eaves flashing should finish on the horizontal face of the eaves flashing\nso that is is not exposed to UV or able to flap in the wind.\nAll underlays, particularly those made from synthetics (including some foils), may be vulnerable to degradation\nfrom fumes and reflected UV. Advice should be requested from the supplier when they are to be used in a\nsituation where they may be exposed to fumes or reflected UV.\n10.11.6 \nInstalling Underlay \nUnderlay can be laid vertically or horizontally. Side laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for roofs and 75 mm for\nwalls; end laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for both roof and wall cladding. At the eaves, the underlay should\nterminate on the upper side of the eaves flashing or overhang fascia by no more than 20 mm.\nThe COP recommends that all underlay is terminated at the ridge, and if not it should be slit or slotted to allow\npassive ventilation of the ceiling cavity.\nThe COP allows roof and wall underlay to be laid either vertically or horizontally in all cases. However, that is in\ndivergence with E2/AS1, so it is advised for buildings within the scope of E2/AS1 (ie, buildings designed within\nthe scope of NZS 3604) that the requirements of the local BCA (Building Consent Authority) is sought before\ndiverging from E2/AS1.\nRips smaller than 75 mm on walls or roofs can be repaired using a compatible flashing tape, but roof underlay\ndamage greater than this requires a new piece of underlay captured by the cladding fastenings.\nFlue penetrations must have a minimum distance of 50 mm from the outer liner to any underlay or flammable\nmaterial.\nE2/AS1 requires self-support underlay laid horizontally on support to be used at pitches below 10 deg . That is not a\nrequirement of the COP as underlay support is no substitute for good ventilation design and effective\nweathertight details.\nWhen using vented battens, the underlay should be positioned on the upper side of the batten, directly under the\nroof cladding. Having the underlay directly under the roof allows the battens to vent the roof cavity directly and\nallows the underlay to perform its normal design function; putting roofing underlay under ventilated battens\nimpedes roof cavity ventilation\nWith re-roofs in any material, it is not acceptable to lay a new roof over existing underlay or underlay support,\nunless the latter is in \"as new\" condition. See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium Sheeting.\nWall underlays must have a minimum side lap of 150 mm and an end lap of 75 mm. Wall underlay on a drained\ncavity should be on the dry (inside) face of the cavity, and be rigid enough to restrain wall insulation from\ncontacting the cladding, or have secondary strapping to achieve such.\n 10 \n 10.11 UNDERLAY\n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n331\nThis is a controlled document.

Under metal tiles, self-supporting underlay can be laid over the roof trusses at spans up to\n1.2 m.\nUnderlay laid horizontally must be laid starting at the lowest point of the roof, running over the bottom purlin and\nmust overlap into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm to prevent wicking. When an eaves flashing is used the\nunderlay should terminate on the downslope of the flashing.\nTo lay roof underlay horizontally, more than one roll can be progressively unrolled, one roofing sheet width at a\ntime. Running multiple rolls straight can, however, be difficult in windy conditions.\n10.11.6.2 \nVertical Laying \nThe laps on vertically laid roof underlay may face in either direction, as the direction of lay is usually dictated by\nconstruction sequencing or wind direction at the time of laying.\nThe bottom end of vertically laid roof underlay must overlap into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm to prevent\nwicking. When an eaves flashing is used the underlay should terminate on the downslope of the flashing.\n10.11.6.3 \nUnderlay Support \nSelf-supporting underlays in lined roof spaces may be laid unsupported at spans up to 1.2 m. Other underlays\nmust be supported. Underlay support may be safety mesh, hexagonal galvanised wire netting, builders' tape, or\nother suitably strong and durable material.\nSafety mesh must be designed and installed to comply with the requirements of the AS/NZS 4389:2015\nCorroded galvanised safety mesh and wire netting can be damaging to any metal roofing and especially to pre-\npainted aluminium. Pre-painted aluminium cladding must be protected from contact with potentially corroding\nsteel including netting, staples, or fasteners, See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium Sheeting\n 10 \n 10.11 UNDERLAY\n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n332\nThis is a controlled document.

Some\ncondensation is inevitable, and it must be managed to ensure the wetness is not excessive in either degree or\nduration - allowing moisture to accumulate.\nIn typical cold roof construction, the insulation is at ceiling level and there is an air gap between the insulation\nand the roof surface.\n10.12.2 \nWarm Roofs \nWith Warm Roofs, the insulation is in direct continuous contact with the underside of the roof. The most\ncommon form of Warm Roof in New Zealand is pre-formed insulation panel. Other proprietary systems may\nconsist of several layers with a vapour control layer on the underside.\nWarm roofs do not inherently have the same natural ventilation as a cold roof, so the internal environment may\nrequire management to prevent condensation problems.\n10.12.3 \nNight Sky Radiation \nRoof cladding absorbs radiation from the sun and the attic space becomes warmer; some of this\nheat is radiated into a clear sky at night.\nBecause all objects radiate heat to cooler objects, night sky radiation will occur when there are no\nclouds in the sky. The radiation rate depends on the emittance of the roof cladding.\nRadiation to the sky can cause the cladding temperature to drop as much as 5C below that of the\nsurrounding air; that causes dew when the surface temperature reaches dew point or frost if the\ntemperature falls below zero.\n10.12.4 \nThe Mechanics of Condensation \nWater exists in 3 states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapour).\n 10 \n 10.12 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n333\nThis is a controlled document.

The water molecule itself is light compared with other gases in the atmosphere, so it\ntends to migrate upwards, ie, into the roof space.\nWater vapour may condense into a liquid form when the concentration rises or the temperature drops. The\ntemperature at which air can hold no more water is called the 'Dew Point'. The water vapour capacity of air is\nrelative to temperature.\n 10 \n 10.12 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n334\nThis is a controlled document.

For instance, a parcel of air at 15 deg C and 50% RH is cooled down to\nhaving increased. Relative Humidity expresses how close the air is to being saturated with water vapour. Warm\nair can hold more moisture in absolute terms, cold air less. If the air becomes saturated (RH 100%) water vapour\nwill condense as mist in the air or as water on adjacent cold surfaces. \nRelative humidity is a suitable measure when the risk of condensation on surfaces or mould growth is to be\nevaluated. \n 10 \n 10.12 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n335\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n10.12.6 \nAbsolute Humidity \nAbsolute Humidity is measured in grams of water per volume of air (grams per cubic metre [g/m ]). It is not\ntemperature dependent and in the example above the absolute humidity would remain unchanged at around 6.4\ng/m , regardless of the temperature change.\nAbsolute humidity is a suitable measure if one is looking for sources or sinks of water in an environment where\ntemperature is changing. If the absolute humidity is cycling during the day, eg, increases in a roof cavity as the\ntemperature rises during the day. It could indicate that moisture is released by the building materials during the\nday and absorbed or condenses during the cooler nights. \n10.12.7 \nWater Vapour Pressure \nWater Vapour Pressure is more based on the fundamental physics and expresses the contribution (ie, the partial\npressure) of water vapour to the total pressure of an air mix. For example, at a pressure of 1000 Pa (1kPa), the\npartial pressure of nitrogen may be 700 Pa, the partial pressure of oxygen 200 Pa and the partial pressure of water\nvapour 99 Pa, and other gases 1 Pa. \nThis parameter is useful to evaluate moisture migration from one point in the building to another. \n3\n3\n 10 \n 10.12 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n336\nThis is a controlled document.

Mould was worst in rental accommodation, where much of our most vulnerable population live.\nIn addition to the health effects, excessive internal moisture impacts material durability.

Problems arise in ceiling spaces when more water vapour enters than exits, and materials\nstay wet for long periods, or where standing water accumulates.\nThe primary purpose of roof cladding is to act as a rain screen so that no water enters the building from the\noutside. It is, however, equally important to ensure that the building is kept dry from inside. Because metal is a\ngood heat conductor and is not absorbent, condensation forms on metal cladding under conditions of high\nhumidity when surface temperatures drop below the dew point.\nThe solutions in the Code of Practice apply to cold roofs, where there is a gap between the ceiling insulation and\nthe roofing material. 10.12.2 Warm Roofs require specific design to avoid internal moisture problems.

The second line is preventing excessive amounts of moisture entering the ceiling cavity. It is\nrecommended that all ceilings are square stopped and all penetrations (cables, pipes, hatches, etc.) are caulked.\nOnly use downlights that are airtight and have a gasket\nA gloss painted plasterboard ceiling presents some resistance to the passage of water vapour but is not a\ncomplete barrier. Vapour will also find its way through any minor gaps in architectural details, and it is air\ntransport through gaps that is responsible for 95% of the passage of water vapour into the ceiling space.\nCeiling tiles and tongue and groove ceilings are considerably more porous than plasterboard. Unsealed\ndownlights can be a major source of moisture movement into the ceiling cavity and should be avoided where\npossible.\nSee BRANZ Facts Roof Ventilation #3 .\nIn some older New Zealand homes, vapour barriers have been used to limit entry of moist air into the ceiling\nspace, but control of air movement into the cavity and removal of damp air by ventilation is a more practical\napproach.\nCavity systems prescribed under E2AS1 9.1.8.1, except those behind masonry veneer, are classified as drained\nnot ventilated. That means they must be closed at the top to restrict air movement between the cavity and the\nroof space. Closing a cavity off at the top still allows reasonable ventilation of the cavity while preventing\nexcessive amounts of moisture rising to the ceiling space. Alternatively, wall cavities can be vented externally.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \nCAVITY\n 9 \n 10 \n 10.9 \n318\nThis is a controlled document.

If insulation is flush with the underside of the purlins it can\nbe done using a vented batten between the purlin and the underlay, or by using fleece lined roofing material.\nApex:\nMaking the roof underlay discontinuous at the apex by cutting or slitting the underlay and using a vented\nsoft edge or vented ridge.\nSarked roofs must have a gap in the sarking at eaves and apex, or by an alternative eaves-to-apex passage.\nWith skillion roof or flat roof construction, the air volume is significantly reduced, so moisture saturation levels\nare more quickly reached. Also with these roof types, air flow paths are more easily obstructed. In skillion roofs\nwith tongue and groove ceilings, a layer of roof underlay immediately above the ceiling will provide a vapour\ncheck and air barrier to compensate for the porosity of the ceiling. For more advice on skillion roof ventilation,\nsee https://www.branz.co.nz/pubs/branz-facts/roof-ventilation/4-skillion-roofs/\nRoofs continuous over an apex, such as barrel curved roofs or roofs with prickled ridges, must have adequate\nventilation to prevent the accumulation of moisture at the apex.\nLong low-pitched roofs will benefit from increased ventilation which may also assist in minimising thermally\ninduced expansion noise. Ventilation typically increases as the roof pitch increases. Air movement through the\ncrests depends on the spacing and area of the crests, roof pitch, and overall length of the sheeting. Corrugate and\ntrapezoidal roofing provide more ventilation than secret-fix roofing. Ventilation through the crests still depends\non air being allowed to enter at the eaves and escape at the apex.\nTrough or tray section roofs have smaller ventilation channels and may require additional ventilation.\nThe use of profiled closures at eaves or ridge will create a substantial air barrier, and alternative ventilation paths\nmust be created.\nAdditional roof space ventilation may take the form of:\nlouvre vents in gable-ends,\nsoffit vents,\nproprietary ridge vents,\nventilated soft edge strips on transverse flashings, or\nmechanical or wind-powered vents positioned close to the apex.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n321\nThis is a controlled document.

More air escaping at the ridge than entering at the eaves can lower the pressure of the\nattic cavity and encourage more ingress of moist air from the dwelling area.\nIn pitches of 30 deg or less cross venting from eaves to eaves alone is generally enough when combined with natural\npassive ventilation at the apex.\nA common rule of thumb is to have a total ventilation cross-section area equal to 1/300 of the ceiling area. In NZ\nbuildings, much smaller ratios have proven sufficient in most cases.\nIncreasing roof space ventilation above the insulation has only a small effect on R values. Ventilation of spaces\nabove bulk insulation is not only desirable but prevents insulation losing effectiveness due to absorbing\nmoisture.\nPartial filling of a ceiling cavity with bulk insulation in flat roofs can severely reduce the amount of free air\navailable to absorb incoming water vapour, thereby increasing saturation levels. Adding insulation while re-roofing\nmust be done with due consideration; unless the amount of ventilation of the cavity is increased or a vapour\ncheck layer is used below the insulation, internal moisture problems can occur.\n10.10.1 \nMethods of Ventilation \nThe primary purpose of ventilation is to replace the moist air in the ceiling cavity with drier air from outdoors.\nAs warm, wet air tends to rise, a vent placed in the soffit or at the lower end of a roof will normally operate as an\nintake vent and a vent at the apex as an exhaust vent, but wind direction can reverse this relationship. Gable-end\nvents or vents aligned horizontally will act as an intake or exhaust depending on the wind direction.\n10.10.1.1 \nSoffit Vents \nSoffit vents can be made in a range of styles to suit the application. As wind pressure differentials are highest at\nthe eaves, they are an efficient ventilation solution and they are also very weather resistant. Soffit vents should\nalways be installed to allow free movement of air into the cavity and should not be blocked on the interior side by\ninsulation or other material.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n322\nThis is a controlled document.

Fascia vents should be\nused in conjunction with a high fronted spouting so that the ends of the sheet and the vent are not exposed to\ndriven rain.\n10.10.1.3 \nRidge Vents \nRidge vents, such as continuous or intermittent ridge vents or vented head apron flashings, should always be used\nin conjunction with intake vents at a lower level.\nTo prevent creating negative pressures which can draw more moist internal air into the ceiling space, the free\nsurface area of ridge vents should always be less than that of eaves vents.\nSaturated water vapour can enter the building when commercial ridge vents are subjected to negative pressures\nor at times of high humidity associated with mist or fog. Such water vapour can form condensation on the\nstructural framework and appear as a leak. Ridge vents without adequate intake vents can also lead to leakage.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n323\nThis is a controlled document.

The latter is more\ncommon. The PIB rubber, when dressed down on a hot day, can adhere to the roofing surface and prevent the\nescape of air at the apex. By removing all or most of the PIB backing this is avoided, and the perforations in the\naluminium become an effective pathway for trickle ventilation, while still being an effective baffle against wind-\nblown moisture. This product is marketed as vented soft edge and is available from all suppliers.\n10.10.1.4A Vented Soft Edge on Corrugate\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n324\nThis is a controlled document.

This creates a low-pressure area, so they draw air\nfrom the ventilated area at a greater rate than stationary vents. The amount of air movement can be dampened\nbut is normally uncontrolled; it is developed as a function of wind speed as well as turbine size and efficiency.\nTurbine vents, unlike commercial ridge vents, are unaffected by wind direction and they are less prone to leaking.\n10.10.2 \nBattens \nBattens may be required to create a separation space between the roofing and the underlay. In some applications,\nthey may need to be ventilated to achieve sufficient airflow.\nThe type and number of fixings required to fix the counter battens to the roof structure must meet the design wind\nload, or the roof fasteners should be long enough to achieve the required penetration into the purlin below.\nBattens or counter battens, if not fixed by extended cladding fasteners, can be fixed using countersunk purlin\nscrews or if fixed with hex headed screws, they should be counter-bored before installation to avoid damage to\nthe roof cladding.\nSteel top hat, C or Z sections are also used as counter battens but require an additional insulating spacer to\navoid thermal bridging.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n325\nThis is a controlled document.

This works\nin the same manner as roofing underlay, absorbing condensation into the fleece and releasing it into the\natmosphere when ambient conditions improve.\nThe fleece follows the contours of the profile. By removing the separate layer of underlay, every crest becomes a\npathway for ventilation. On a gable roof, this will approximately double the air changes in a roof over conventional\nconstruction, without the height disruption, cost, or inconvenience of a ventilated batten.\nAnother advantage of these products is that they greatly increase speed of lay of a roof, and avoid delays due to\nexcessive wind. They are available on all corrugate and trapezoidal profiles.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10 \n 10 \n 10.10 \n326\nThis is a controlled document.

            "content": "Where eave-vent intakes and ridge-vent exits are both employed, the area of the ridge vents should be less than\nthat of the eave vents. More air escaping at the ridge than entering at the eaves can lower the pressure of the\nattic cavity and encourage more ingress of moist air from the dwelling area.\nIn pitches of 30 deg or less cross venting from eaves to eaves alone is generally enough when combined with natural\npassive ventilation at the apex.\nA common rule of thumb is to have a total ventilation cross-section area equal to 1/300 of the ceiling area. In NZ\nbuildings, much smaller ratios have proven sufficient in most cases.\nIncreasing roof space ventilation above the insulation has only a small effect on R values. Ventilation of spaces\nabove bulk insulation is not only desirable but prevents insulation losing effectiveness due to absorbing\nmoisture.\nPartial filling of a ceiling cavity with bulk insulation in flat roofs can severely reduce the amount of free air\navailable to absorb incoming water vapour, thereby increasing saturation levels. Adding insulation while re-roofing\nmust be done with due consideration; unless the amount of ventilation of the cavity is increased or a vapour\ncheck layer is used below the insulation, internal moisture problems can occur.\n10.10.1 \nMethods of Ventilation \nThe primary purpose of ventilation is to replace the moist air in the ceiling cavity with drier air from outdoors.\nAs warm, wet air tends to rise, a vent placed in the soffit or at the lower end of a roof will normally operate as an\nintake vent and a vent at the apex as an exhaust vent, but wind direction can reverse this relationship. Gable-end\nvents or vents aligned horizontally will act as an intake or exhaust depending on the wind direction.\n10.10.1.1 \nSoffit Vents \nSoffit vents can be made in a range of styles to suit the application. As wind pressure differentials are highest at\nthe eaves, they are an efficient ventilation solution and they are also very weather resistant.

Containment is normally achieved by using an absorbent roofing underlay. It is\nthe role of roofing underlay to absorb moisture temporarily and then release it back into the atmosphere.\nA printable bulletin about installing underlay when reroofing is\navailable at: BU01 Double laying of Underlay on Re-roof\nExtract:\n\"...we recommend that no more than a single layer of compliant underlay (laps\nexcluded) is present on a profiled metal roof.\"\nA common misconception holds that the roofing underlay acts as a drainage plane, channelling condensation\nfrom the underside of the metal roof to the gutter. In practice, most of the condensation forms on the underside\nof the underlay. Although roofing underlays are permeable, they still form a substantial vapour check, and as they\nare in contact with the roof, they are at a similar temperature. Any condensation that does form on the underside\nof the roof and falls onto the underlay generally only tracks down the underlay as far as the next purlin, where it is\ntrapped and absorbed by the underlay. Underlay is also affected by holes from roofing fasteners, making it\nunreliable as a \"second roof\".\nAs it is designed to execute its primary purpose of aiding in the management of internal moisture, underlay\nshould not be used as a compensation for unreliable weatherproofing design and installation\n10.11A Roof Cavity Condensation\nSmall Space:Condensation on \nunderside of cladding;often not muc\nbecause of small air volume.\nCondensation on top can be large \nwhen air is moist and calm.\nPermeable underlay in contact with \ncladding gets cold. The resulting \ncondensation get absorbed by the \nunderlay, which can be significant if \nthe attic air is moist.\nPermeable underlay stays a \nbit warmer, no condensation\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n327\nThis is a controlled document.

Not only the underlay will be saturated, but so will the ceiling structural\nmembers and insulation; mould, corrosion, and decay are inevitable. The cure is to decrease the amount of\nmoisture entering the ceiling cavity or increase ventilation of the ceiling space.\n10.11C Chronic Condensation \nChronic condensation problem caused by induction of moist air into the ceiling cavity.

Refer NZBC C/AS3-AS6, clause 4.17.8 \nUnderlays designated as self-supporting can be laid without support at spans up to 1.2 m.\nOther requirements for underlays vary for different cladding systems, but the important features of absorbency,\npermeability, water resistance, tensile strength, edge tear resistance, PH, and durability are important to comply\nwith the requirements of the NZBC.\nThe Code of Practice recommends synthetic self-supporting fire-retardant underlays for residential roofing\napplications.\n10.11.3 \nTypes Of Underlay \nApart from their fire retardance and ability to self-support, underlays are classified according to their absorbency\nand permeability.\nPermeable and Absorbent:\nKraft paper-based - bitumen impregnated paper\nSynthetic - 2 or 3 layers, using permeable synthetic film strengthened by sandwiched non-woven fabric.\nPermeable, non-absorbent:\nSynthetic permeable non-absorbent underlays are mainly used as wall wrap inside a drained cavity or with\ndirect fixed absorbent claddings.\nNon-Permeable, non-absorbent:\nfoil - Reflective aluminium foil over a flexible substrate. These can be either double-sided or white-faced.\n10.11.4 \nUnderlay Usage \nIn lined buildings and dwellings, an absorbent permeable underlay is required under metal roofs. The same applies\nto direct-fixed steel wall cladding, but underlays used behind a drained cavity are not required to be absorbent.\nFor aesthetic reasons, a foil-faced (or white-faced) vapour check layer may be used in unlined commercial or\nindustrial applications to reduce heat radiation from the roof cladding and provide enhancement of light. For\ninsulated applications, foil is normally used as a vapour check under the insulation and an absorbent permeable\nunderlay used above with a 20 mm gap from the roof cladding.\nOn non-residential dwellings, profiled roof-light sheeting running in continuous lengths from the ridge can have\nmultiple skins to avoid condensation dripping from the sheeting or plastic sheet with a spacer can be used to\nlessen condensation. Roof underlays should not be laid continuously under translucent roof or wall cladding.\n10.11.5 \nUnderlay Durability \n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n330\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nNZBC Clause B2.3.1 requires non-structural building elements and those that are moderately difficult to replace\nto have a durability of 15 years, or, if difficult to replace, to have the same durability as the more durable elements\nof a system. Alternatively, the design should allow the replacement of the less durable elements without\nremoving the more durable components.\nCompliance with NZBC B2, therefore, requires roofing underlay to have durability equal to that of the roof\ncladding and no less than 15 years.\nWhen finishing on an eaves flashing the eaves flashing should finish on the horizontal face of the eaves flashing\nso that is is not exposed to UV or able to flap in the wind.\nAll underlays, particularly those made from synthetics (including some foils), may be vulnerable to degradation\nfrom fumes and reflected UV. Advice should be requested from the supplier when they are to be used in a\nsituation where they may be exposed to fumes or reflected UV.\n10.11.6 \nInstalling Underlay \nUnderlay can be laid vertically or horizontally. Side laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for roofs and 75 mm for\nwalls; end laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for both roof and wall cladding. At the eaves, the underlay should\nterminate on the upper side of the eaves flashing or overhang fascia by no more than 20 mm.\nThe COP recommends that all underlay is terminated at the ridge, and if not it should be slit or slotted to allow\npassive ventilation of the ceiling cavity.\nThe COP allows roof and wall underlay to be laid either vertically or horizontally in all cases. However, that is in\ndivergence with E2/AS1, so it is advised for buildings within the scope of E2/AS1 (ie, buildings designed within\nthe scope of NZS 3604) that the requirements of the local BCA (Building Consent Authority) is sought before\ndiverging from E2/AS1.\nRips smaller than 75 mm on walls or roofs can be repaired using a compatible flashing tape, but roof underlay\ndamage greater than this requires a new piece of underlay captured by the cladding fastenings.\nFlue penetrations must have a minimum distance of 50 mm from the outer liner to any underlay or flammable\nmaterial.\nE2/AS1 requires self-support underlay laid horizontally on support to be used at pitches below 10 deg . That is not a\nrequirement of the COP as underlay support is no substitute for good ventilation design and effective\nweathertight details.\nWhen using vented battens, the underlay should be positioned on the upper side of the batten, directly under the\nroof cladding. Having the underlay directly under the roof allows the battens to vent the roof cavity directly and\nallows the underlay to perform its normal design function; putting roofing underlay under ventilated battens\nimpedes roof cavity ventilation\nWith re-roofs in any material, it is not acceptable to lay a new roof over existing underlay or underlay support,\nunless the latter is in \"as new\" condition. See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium Sheeting.\nWall underlays must have a minimum side lap of 150 mm and an end lap of 75 mm. Wall underlay on a drained\ncavity should be on the dry (inside) face of the cavity, and be rigid enough to restrain wall insulation from\ncontacting the cladding, or have secondary strapping to achieve such.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n331\nThis is a controlled document.

Under metal tiles, self-supporting underlay can be laid over the roof trusses at spans up to\n1.2 m.\nUnderlay laid horizontally must be laid starting at the lowest point of the roof, running over the bottom purlin and\nmust overlap into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm to prevent wicking. When an eaves flashing is used the\nunderlay should terminate on the downslope of the flashing.\nTo lay roof underlay horizontally, more than one roll can be progressively unrolled, one roofing sheet width at a\ntime. Running multiple rolls straight can, however, be difficult in windy conditions.\n10.11.6.2 \nVertical Laying \nThe laps on vertically laid roof underlay may face in either direction, as the direction of lay is usually dictated by\nconstruction sequencing or wind direction at the time of laying.\nThe bottom end of vertically laid roof underlay must overlap into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm to prevent\nwicking. When an eaves flashing is used the underlay should terminate on the downslope of the flashing.\n10.11.6.3 \nUnderlay Support \nSelf-supporting underlays in lined roof spaces may be laid unsupported at spans up to 1.2 m. Other underlays\nmust be supported. Underlay support may be safety mesh, hexagonal galvanised wire netting, builders' tape, or\nother suitably strong and durable material.\nSafety mesh must be designed and installed to comply with the requirements of the AS/NZS 4389:2015\nCorroded galvanised safety mesh and wire netting can be damaging to any metal roofing and especially to pre-\npainted aluminium. Pre-painted aluminium cladding must be protected from contact with potentially corroding\nsteel including netting, staples, or fasteners, See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium Sheeting\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n332\nThis is a controlled document.

Containment is normally achieved by using an absorbent roofing underlay. It is\nthe role of roofing underlay to absorb moisture temporarily and then release it back into the atmosphere.\nA printable bulletin about installing underlay when reroofing is\navailable at: BU01 Double laying of Underlay on Re-roof\nExtract:\n\"...we recommend that no more than a single layer of compliant underlay (laps\nexcluded) is present on a profiled metal roof.\"\nA common misconception holds that the roofing underlay acts as a drainage plane, channelling condensation\nfrom the underside of the metal roof to the gutter. In practice, most of the condensation forms on the underside\nof the underlay. Although roofing underlays are permeable, they still form a substantial vapour check, and as they\nare in contact with the roof, they are at a similar temperature. Any condensation that does form on the underside\nof the roof and falls onto the underlay generally only tracks down the underlay as far as the next purlin, where it is\ntrapped and absorbed by the underlay. Underlay is also affected by holes from roofing fasteners, making it\nunreliable as a \"second roof\".\nAs it is designed to execute its primary purpose of aiding in the management of internal moisture, underlay\nshould not be used as a compensation for unreliable weatherproofing design and installation\nSmall Space:Condensation on \nunderside of cladding;often not muc\nbecause of small air volume.\nCondensation on top can be large \nwhen air is moist and calm.\nPermeable underlay in contact with \ncladding gets cold.

            "content": "NZBC Clause B2.3.1 requires non-structural building elements and those that are moderately difficult to replace\nto have a durability of 15 years, or, if difficult to replace, to have the same durability as the more durable elements\nof a system. Alternatively, the design should allow the replacement of the less durable elements without\nremoving the more durable components.\nCompliance with NZBC B2, therefore, requires roofing underlay to have durability equal to that of the roof\ncladding and no less than 15 years.\nWhen finishing on an eaves flashing the eaves flashing should finish on the horizontal face of the eaves flashing\nso that is is not exposed to UV or able to flap in the wind.\nAll underlays, particularly those made from synthetics (including some foils), may be vulnerable to degradation\nfrom fumes and reflected UV. Advice should be requested from the supplier when they are to be used in a\nsituation where they may be exposed to fumes or reflected UV.\n10.11.6 \nInstalling Underlay \nUnderlay can be laid vertically or horizontally. Side laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for roofs and 75 mm for\nwalls; end laps must be a minimum of 150 mm for both roof and wall cladding. At the eaves, the underlay should\nterminate on the upper side of the eaves flashing or overhang fascia by no more than 20 mm.\nThe COP recommends that all underlay is terminated at the ridge, and if not it should be slit or slotted to allow\npassive ventilation of the ceiling cavity.\nThe COP allows roof and wall underlay to be laid either vertically or horizontally in all cases. However, that is in\ndivergence with E2/AS1, so it is advised for buildings within the scope of E2/AS1 (ie, buildings designed within\nthe scope of NZS 3604) that the requirements of the local BCA (Building Consent Authority) is sought before\ndiverging from E2/AS1.\nRips smaller than 75 mm on walls or roofs can be repaired using a compatible flashing tape, but roof underlay\ndamage greater than this requires a new piece of underlay captured by the cladding fastenings.\nFlue penetrations must have a minimum distance of 50 mm from the outer liner to any underlay or flammable\nmaterial.\nE2/AS1 requires self-support underlay laid horizontally on support to be used at pitches below 10 deg . That is not a\nrequirement of the COP as underlay support is no substitute for good ventilation design and effective\nweathertight details.\nWhen using vented battens, the underlay should be positioned on the upper side of the batten, directly under the\nroof cladding. Having the underlay directly under the roof allows the battens to vent the roof cavity directly and\nallows the underlay to perform its normal design function; putting roofing underlay under ventilated battens\nimpedes roof cavity ventilation\nWith re-roofs in any material, it is not acceptable to lay a new roof over existing underlay or underlay support,\nunless the latter is in \"as new\" condition. See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium Sheeting.\nWall underlays must have a minimum side lap of 150 mm and an end lap of 75 mm. Wall underlay on a drained\ncavity should be on the dry (inside) face of the cavity, and be rigid enough to restrain wall insulation from\ncontacting the cladding, or have secondary strapping to achieve such.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 10.11 UNDERLAY\n 11 \n 10 \n 10.11 \n331\nThis is a controlled document.

Some\ncondensation is inevitable, and it must be managed to ensure the wetness is not excessive in either degree or\nduration - allowing moisture to accumulate.\nIn typical cold roof construction, the insulation is at ceiling level and there is an air gap between the insulation\nand the roof surface.\n10.12.2 \nWarm Roofs \nWith Warm Roofs, the insulation is in direct continuous contact with the underside of the roof. The most\ncommon form of Warm Roof in New Zealand is pre-formed insulation panel. Other proprietary systems may\nconsist of several layers with a vapour control layer on the underside.\nWarm roofs do not inherently have the same natural ventilation as a cold roof, so the internal environment may\nrequire management to prevent condensation problems.\n10.12.3 \nNight Sky Radiation \nRoof cladding absorbs radiation from the sun and the attic space becomes warmer; some of this\nheat is radiated into a clear sky at night.\nBecause all objects radiate heat to cooler objects, night sky radiation will occur when there are no\nclouds in the sky. The radiation rate depends on the emittance of the roof cladding.\nRadiation to the sky can cause the cladding temperature to drop as much as 5C below that of the\nsurrounding air; that causes dew when the surface temperature reaches dew point or frost if the\ntemperature falls below zero.\n10.12.4 \nThe Mechanics of Condensation \nWater exists in 3 states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapour).\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n333\nThis is a controlled document.

The water molecule itself is light compared with other gases in the atmosphere, so it\ntends to migrate upwards, ie, into the roof space.\nWater vapour may condense into a liquid form when the concentration rises or the temperature drops. The\ntemperature at which air can hold no more water is called the 'Dew Point'. The water vapour capacity of air is\nrelative to temperature.\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n334\nThis is a controlled document.

For instance, a parcel of air at 15 deg C and 50% RH is cooled down to\n10 deg C. Now, the relative humidity of this parcel of air will be close to 70%, without the actual amount of water\nhaving increased. Relative Humidity expresses how close the air is to being saturated with water vapour. Warm\nair can hold more moisture in absolute terms, cold air less. If the air becomes saturated (RH 100%) water vapour\nwill condense as mist in the air or as water on adjacent cold surfaces. \nRelative humidity is a suitable measure when the risk of condensation on surfaces or mould growth is to be\nevaluated. \n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n335\nThis is a controlled document.

It is not\ntemperature dependent and in the example above the absolute humidity would remain unchanged at around 6.4\ng/m , regardless of the temperature change.\nAbsolute humidity is a suitable measure if one is looking for sources or sinks of water in an environment where\ntemperature is changing. If the absolute humidity is cycling during the day, eg, increases in a roof cavity as the\ntemperature rises during the day. It could indicate that moisture is released by the building materials during the\nday and absorbed or condenses during the cooler nights. \n10.12.7 \nWater Vapour Pressure \nWater Vapour Pressure is more based on the fundamental physics and expresses the contribution (ie, the partial\npressure) of water vapour to the total pressure of an air mix. For example, at a pressure of 1000 Pa (1kPa), the\npartial pressure of nitrogen may be 700 Pa, the partial pressure of oxygen 200 Pa and the partial pressure of water\nvapour 99 Pa, and other gases 1 Pa. \nThis parameter is useful to evaluate moisture migration from one point in the building to another. \n3\n3\n 10 INTERNAL MOISTURE\n 10 \n 12 \n 10 \n 10.12 \n336\nThis is a controlled document.

For other applications such as housing, polycarbonate\nsheeting is more commonly used. Polycarbonate is available in stock sheet lengths of up to 7.2 metres.\nProfiled PVC roof lights are now rare as they suffer from embrittlement when exposed to UV.\nGRP combines polyester resin and chopped glass fibre. AS/NZS 4256.3 requires sheets to contain a minimum of\n22% glass fibre by mass and to be marked with their classification and weight.\n11.2A Comparison of GRP and Polycarbonate.\nGRP\nPolycarbonate\nAvailable in all profiles\nAvailable in limited profiles\nAvailable in long run\nAvailable in standard lengths\nAvailable in different thicknesses\nAvailable in one thickness\nDurability >25 years\nDurability >25 years\nWill lose transparency with age\nWill maintain initial transparency\nGives diffuse light\nGives direct light\nThermal expansion 2 x that of steel\nThermal expansion 5x that of steel\nAvailable in tinted or opaque\nAvailable tinted\nReasonable light transparency\nExcellent light transparency\nPolycarbonate is more popular for shorter runs and continuous widths, where clarity and stable appearance are\nconsidered an aesthetic attribute.\nStand-alone and flat-sheet roof lights may be manufactured from translucent or transparent polycarbonate,\nacrylic, or glass sheeting.\n11.2.1 \nGlass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) \nGlass Reinforced Plastic ( GRP ) combines polyester resin and chopped glass fibre. AS/NZS 4256.3\nrequires sheets to contain a minimum of 22% glass fibre by mass and to be marked with their\nclassification and weight.\nGRP is suitable for in-service temperatures of -10 deg to 70 deg C and some GRP sheets are available in a\nfire resistant grade.\nGRP should have a minimum thickness of 1.1 mm, but it is available up to 3 mm thick.\n 11 \n 11.2 NATURAL LIGHT MATERIALS\n 2 \n 11 \n 11.2 \n339\nThis is a controlled document.

Sheets can have a film or a coating on one or both sides or have a film on one side\nand a coating on the other. The performance of GRP is related to both light transmission and\ndurability of the various films, and coatings can provide different performance for each category in\ndifferent environments.\nN.B. Performance in both of these areas is not necessarily directly related.\nThe roofing contractor must ensure that the correct weathering surface of plastic sheeting is placed\nuppermost as the durability and warranty depend on placing the sheet the correct side up.\n11.2.2 \nPolycarbonate \nPolycarbonate is a tough, clear thermoplastic polymer with a higher deformation temperature than\nPVC.\nPolycarbonate is manufactured with a co-extruded UV resistant top layer, which will resist\nweathering, but its durability depends on the thickness of the top layer.\nProfiled polycarbonate sheeting has a limited spanning capacity and requires greater provision for\nexpansion than GRP. It is available in thicknesses from 0.8 mm to 1.5 mm but is only available in a\nlimited range of profiles.\nFlat multi-wall extruded sheets with one or more air gaps have a thinner wall thickness but derive\ntheir rigidity from the shape of the profile. They are limited in spanning capability, but come in\nwide sheets, fixed into proprietary extrusions, and are suitable as continuous barrel vaults and as\ndouble skin roof lights.\nSurface coatings provide different levels of durability, chemical resistance and weather resistance.\nPolycarbonate sheets must not be fitted above sprinklers as they can drop out in a fire and interfere\nwith the sprinkler's function.\n11.2.3 \nPVC \nPVC is a compound of polyvinyl chloride manufactured with stabilisers but without plasticisers that complies\nwith AS/NZS 4256.2. Profiled PVC roof lights have a limited spanning capacity and need greater provision for\nexpansion than other plastics or metals.\n 11 \n 11.2 NATURAL LIGHT MATERIALS\n 2 \n 11 \n 11.2 \n340\nThis is a controlled document.

PVC softens at 80 deg C and will act as a smoke vent when heated during a fire. It has a service temperature\nof 60 deg C and a tensile strength of 52 MPa at 20 deg C.\nPVC may not satisfy the 15-year durability requirements of the NZBC; it is not regarded as suitable\nfor commercial or industrial use and should not be used in habitable buildings.\nPVC sheets must not be fitted above sprinklers, as they can drop out during a fire and interfere with the\nsprinkler's function.\n 11 \n 11.2 NATURAL LIGHT MATERIALS\n 2 \n 11 \n 11.2 \n341\nThis is a controlled document.

The test provisions of AS/NZS 4257 require the measure\nto be calculated from the area of the profile, including the overlap. Because the mass of plastic sheeting varies\nbetween profiles, the thickness will vary for different profiles of a given weight per square metre. Deeper profiled\nproducts are usually supplied as standard at a greater weight per square metre than more material-efficient\nprofiles.\n11.3.1 \nPoint Load on Translucent Sheets \nStandard profiled roof lights are classified as brittle roofing and are not suitable for roof traffic. They are normally\nlaid over safety mesh to AS 4859. (See 13.4.4 Safety Netting)\nTrafficable roof lights are normally rendered trafficable by embedding a woven glass mat into the material. They\nmust be tested under the point load test provisions of AS 4040.1, AS/NZS 4040.4, and AS/NZS 1562.3: 2006. \nNon-trafficable sheets over one sheet in width should be provided with a walkway, terminate short of ridge and/or\neaves, to enable transverse traffic.\n11.3.2 \nDistributed Loads on Translucent Sheeting \nThe spanning capacity of profiled roof lights depends on the profile shape, material thickness and composition,\nthe number of fasteners per square metre, and the washer type and size. \nPull-though of the fastener is the most common failure mode of profiled translucent sheeting, so it should always\nbe installed with a load spreading washer unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.\nAdditional support can be obtained from adjacent metal cladding by using mid-span supports, alternatively, the\nthickness of the roof lights may be increased.\nProfiled translucent sheeting must be designed to be capable of withstanding design wind loads, using the\nmanufacturer's literature.\n 11 \n 11.3 PERFORMANCE - STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 11 \n 11.3 \n342\nThis is a controlled document.

Tinting can be coloured or translucent.\nTo decrease heat loss and prevent condensation, multi-skinned systems can be employed to provide insulation.\nIn colder areas, UV-stabilised EVA copolymer film is often used under profiled skylights to minimise\ncondensation. Where buildings are heated, or where condensation cannot be tolerated, multi skinned systems are\nrecommended.\n11.4A Double-Skinned Rooflight.\nMetal roof Rooflight\nLoad \nspreading \nwasher\nPurlin\nFlat multi-wall \nPolycarbonate \nsheet\nPacker, parallel to \nthe purlin\nMetal roof\nUnderlay\nSafety \nmesh\n11.4B Rooflight without Spacers\nFasteners at\neach rib\n36 mm EPDM\nsealing washer\nLoad spreading \nwasher\nPurlin\n 11 \n 11.4 THERMAL RESISTANCE\n 11 \n 11.4 \n344\nThis is a controlled document.

Regular roof light areas range from 5% of the\nfloor area for warehouses to 10 - 15% for industrial buildings, and 20% for sports halls and factories where\nintricate work is done.\nProprietary skylights are usually strategically positioned to bring borrowed light into specific areas that are not\notherwise naturally lit. Often these are also designed to provide ventilation.\n 11 \n 11.5 LIGHT TRANSMISSION\n 5 \n 11 \n 11.5 \n346\nThis is a controlled document.

Some fasteners drill their own clearance holes, otherwise pre-\ndrilling is required. Although GRP has approximately twice the expansion as steel, it absorbs less energy from the\nsun, so the same expansion allowances as used for the adjacent steel sheet can be applied.\nRoof netting and safety mesh can damage GRP through expansion movement and walking traffic. GRP can be\nprotected at the purlin by placing a small slip sheet of GRP between the netting and the roof light.\n11.6A Translucent Sheet End Lap\nLongrun\nMetalroofing\nLap seal tape 16 mm x 3 mm thick\nor 2 beads of neutral curing\nsilicone sealant to achieve a full\nseal across the profile.\nSafety mesh\nSteel Purlin\nFibreglass purlin \nprotectionstrip fixed to \ntop of purlinOver Safety \nmesh.\nTranslucent sheet\n250 mm Cover\n150 mm\nmax\nPolycarbonate sheets expand more than steel, and so are only available in lengths up to 7.2 m. When directly\ninstalling polycarbonate sheets, friction tape can be placed on the purlins to reduce thermally induced noise.\nManufacturers recommend side lap fasteners on translucent sheets to maintain the integrity of the side laps.\nTurn up stop ends are not easily formed with profiled skylights. To prevent blow over at the upper end of sheets,\nan angle or odd leg J-shaped channel is normally attached to the upper end of sheets with rivets and sealed with\nsilicon or MS sealant.\n 11 \n 11.6 INSTALLING TRANSLUCENT SHEETS\n 6 \n 11 \n 11.6 \n347\nThis is a controlled document.

Both are available either clear or tinted and may be integrated with a\npermanent, manually operated, or automated ventilation function.\nRectangular skylights typically consist of a timber or aluminium base which must be flashed into the roof\ncladding, using one of the methods detailed in 9 External Moisture Penetrations. The designer should\nselect which flashing detail is optimal for the application and detail it accordingly. To enable efficient design and\nprevent excessive use of over flashings, designers should also consider the placement of skylights in relation to\neach other and other architectural elements,\nRetrofitted skylights, not included in the original design, often result in unsightly, leaky, and excessive over-\nflashings. Such additions often evade compliance inspections. If skylights are likely to be required, it is strongly\nrecommended that thought be given to their location and design so that they can be appropriately detailed on the\nconsent drawings.\nDome flashings often come with a flashing kit, making them simpler to install, and many have flexible light tubes\nleading to a ceiling light diffuser, avoiding the need to frame out and line the roof space between the skylight and\nthe ceiling. This allows the upper section to be positioned in an optimal position to facilitate flashing design.\n11.7A Skytube\n11.7B Skylight\n 11 \n 11.7 STAND-ALONE ROOFLIGHTS\n 7 \n 11 \n 11.7 \n349\nThis is a controlled document.

Materials may be single or multi skinned glass, polycarbonate or acrylic.\nThese are almost exclusively proprietary systems so design advice should be sought from the\ndistributor/manufacturer.\n 11 \n 11.8 FLATSHEET ROOFLIGHTS\n 8 \n 11 \n 11.8 \n350\nThis is a controlled document.

The movement that\ngenerates sound can be triggered by three main factors:\nWind.\nPrecipitation (rain, hail, or snow).\nTemperature (thermal).\nEach of these can be broken down into sub-groups.\n12.1.1 \nWind Noise \nRoof noise triggered by the wind can take several forms:\nUnderlay flutter,\nBanging of the roof itself, or things against the roof,\nVibration of flashings.\n12.1.1A Underlay Flutter\nUnderlay flutter will be perceived as a high-pitched noise. Depending on its origin, it can be minimised using\nvarious techniques, for example:\nIf it is coming from the eaves, cutting the underlay back from the spouting and installing an eaves flashing.\nIf it is coming from the body of the roof, installing a high front gutter.\nInstalling spray-on foam insulation.\n12.1.1B Wind Banging\nWind banging can be the pan drumming or banging against the sarking or purlin support. It normally only occurs\nwith standing seam profiles and it is a function of the roof design, material thickness, and wind loads. These\nproblems should be referred to the manufacturer or designer.\n12.1.1C Flashing Vibration\nExcessive movement or insufficient clearance between a penetration and the cladding may also cause noise.\nFlashing vibration can be a whistling noise or a high-pitched sound like an engine, known as motor boating. The\nedges of all flashings should have a stiffening fold and the vertical face should be fixed to the structure or wall\ncladding to avoid vibration.\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n352\nThis is a controlled document.

Fleece lined\ncladding has also been found to reduce precipitation noise.\n12.1.3 \nThermal Noise \nNearly all profiled metal roofs will exhibit thermal roof noise at times. Typically, this is a relatively minor and\nuncommon event, and attracts no attention. Sometimes, however, the frequency and/or volume of the noise can\nbe to the point where it causes discomfort and distress to the occupants.\nThermal roof noise is caused by the roof expanding or contracting due to temperature fluctuation. The effect can\nbe immediate as a cloud passes over the sun or delayed as the roof and roof structure cool down at night.\nNot all materials in a roof structure absorb the same amount of heat, and not all materials have the same amount\nof thermally-induced movement. Differential movement may emanate from many places, including the layer of\nroofing exposed to the sun against layers underneath (i.e. a flashing or lap), the roof profile against the fastener,\nor the roof against the support structure. It can also happen when expansion of the roof causes one member of\nthe support structure directly to move against another. Movement may also occur as sudden popping in the pan\nof a profile that releases static friction and causes sound.\nThe source of thermal roof noise can be difficult to identify in many cases. However, roof noise can be divided\ninto three main categories by source. They are:\nFlashings,\npopping of pan, and\nother causes of thermal noise.\nFlashings\nWhere flashings are solid fixed to a vertical surface and to the cladding, differential movement between them and\nthe roof may cause noise. Using clip-fastened systems allowing flashings and roofing to move independently to\neach other will help minimise noise associated with this movement.\nPan Popping\nOil canning, or canning, is the term used to describe visible waviness of the pan of a metal roof. It is most\nnoticeable in roofs with wide trays but may also occur in secret fixed or trapezoidal profiles.\nPan popping is accompanied by canning, but not all canning jobs result in thermal roof noise. Canning is most\nprevalent in tray profiles, but popping roof noise is most often found with trapezoidal or secret fixed roofs.\nCanning can be minimised by good rollformer tooling design and adjustment, but it can also be exacerbated by\nvariations in mechanical properties and shape of the coil.\nEven steel coil well within standard tolerances can have characteristics that lead to high levels of canning in\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n353\nThis is a controlled document.

The exact source of most\nroof noise is hard to identify.\nA common observation of noisy roofs is poor contact between the purlin and the rafter due to insufficient\npressure being put on the purlin when installing purlin screws, allowing the purlin to ride up on the thread. It may\ncreate a source of noise as purlins rotate under thermal expansion forces. Purlin screws should have a length of\nunthreaded shank below the head of at least the purlin thickness.\n12.1.3A Poor Purlin-to-Rafter Connection\nIt is impossible to prevent expansion, but its effects can be minimised.\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n354\nThis is a controlled document.

Lowering roof\ntemperatures minimises thermal noise. Increasing ventilation in the ceiling cavity is the easiest way to lower roof\ntemperatures and may have the added benefit of lowering roof space humidity.\nThe accumulation of stress can be minimised by avoiding excessive run lengths. Friction can be reduced by using\nlow-friction underlay and using oversized fastener holes to allow materials to move freely. Fasteners should be\nchecked for over-tightening and eased if necessary.\nMany roof noise problems are typically associated with long, low, dark skillion roofs, but some noisy roofs have\nnone of those design features. To date, the MRM have not recorded any instances of thermal roof noise with\nroofs fastened to steel purlins or frames.\nThermal roof noise is a modern problem. Although often attributed to the roof material, steel and the profiles we\nform it into have not changed. In one case, a noisy trapezoidal roof was replaced with a corrugated roof\nmanufactured from imported material, and the noise problem remained.\nChanges that have occurred in the industry include:\nroofs are screwed on rather than nailed,\nroofs are longer and darker,\npurlins are screw fastened not nailed,\nhouses are more airtight and far better insulated,\ntrusses have largely replaced rafters, and\nframing timber is lighter and younger.\nIt is possible that a number of these aspects contribute in complex ways to produce varying thermal expansion\nnoise levels, but we certainly don't want to go back to nailed roofs and uninsulated houses.\nThe exact source of much roof noise is still a mystery. Auckland University is currently researching a scientific\napproach to identifying causes and solutions to roof noise.\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n355\nThis is a controlled document.

It will\nbecome much less obvious over time as gloss levels diminish and dirt accumulates on the roof.\nOverdriven nails or screws can produce visible distortion on the purlin line in the pan of trapezoidal profiles that\ncannot be easily remedied.\n12.2A Purlin Creasing on Trapezoidal Profiles\nTrapezoidal profiles with a wide pan manufactured from 0.4 mm steel and 0.7 mm aluminium are\nparticularly susceptible to purlin creasing, and although it does not affect performance, their\nappearance can be aesthetically unacceptable\nIt is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to ensure that nails are not overdriven. A nail or screw should only\nbe driven into the purlin to produce a 50% compression of the sealing washer or until the roof is firm.\nBefore fixing the roof cladding, the contractor should check the alignment of the purlins or girts. Purlins should be\naligned within 5 mm tolerance of each other to avoid purlin creasing.\nPurlins should be accurately positioned with their top face parallel to the rafter and should be fixed to a straight\nline.\nWhen appearance is important or where wide pan trapezoidal cladding is close to eye level, heavier gauge\ncladding should be specified because light gauges such as 0.4 mm steel and 0.7 mm aluminium are likely to\nshow distortion. Purlin creasing will happen on both concave and convex curved roofs if the recommended purlin\nspacings are exceeded, and great care should be taken to align purlins on such roofs.\nPurlin creasing can be exacerbated by roof traffic. 14.5 Walking On Roofs\nAll trapezoidal and secret x proles will exhibit purlin creasing to some degree. The extent to which it is visible\ndepends greatly on the line of sight and light conditions. These can change it from being immediately obvious to\nalmost invisible. Purlin creasing can be minimised by design by specifying 0.55 mm, rather than 0.40 mm\nmaterial, or selecting a prole with a narrower pan.

As this is seldom practical, light,\nevenly spaced waviness in a ridge or transverse flashing is not considered a defect.\nBeing highly visible, waviness in barges and external corner flashings can be more problematic. In a situation\nwhere there is a low tolerance for waviness, flashings should be designed to keep the width of flat surfaces\nminimal and to be clip fastened on both edges to accommodate movement. Where possible, manufacturing from\na heavier gauge material will also help minimise buckling.\nSevere localised irreversible buckling of a flashing caused by compression wood is the result of a defect of the\nstructure and should be rectified. See 8.9 Compression Timber.\n12.3A Flashing Buckling\n 12 \n 12.3 FLASHING BUCKLING\n 3 \n 12 \n 12.3 \n358\nThis is a controlled document.

Flat pan architectural metal panels, wide flashings, and profiled metal cladding with wide\npan configurations without stiffening ribs are all liable to show distortion in flat metal areas. It is known as oil-\ncanning or panning.\nOil canning can be defined as visible waviness in the flat areas of metal roofing and wall cladding. It can also be\nreferred to as panning, canning, stress wrinkling or elastic buckling, and is caused by differential stresses in the\nmetal. As the metal tries to relieve these stresses in panels with high width to thickness ratios, material buckles\nout of plane producing the characteristic waviness of oil canning\nIt has an aesthetic effect and is not a structural or durability issue. Some highly reflective paint finishes and\nmetals or different light conditions can exacerbate the visual effect of oil canning. Some distortion is inevitable in\nlight gauges. It can become an issue of customer acceptance because customer expectations are often\nunrealistically high.\nThe degree of waviness can be hard to measure and is highly dependent on viewing angles, the position of the\nsun, and the reflectivity of the surface. Cladding installations with a high degree of visibility should be designed to\nminimise oil canning.\nOil canning is more common where the width of unformed sections is large. It can usually be avoided or\nminimised in normal rib and trough section profiles with a maximum pan width of 300 mm, and flashings that\nhave a maximum unformed width of 300 mm. See 8.1 Flashing Materials\nIn standing seam roofs with pan widths of more than 300 mm, some oil canning is normally evident. Many\ndesigners regard oil canning in such profiles as inherent to the material and treat it as a desired effect\naccentuating the material's natural characteristics.\nManufacturers and installers should minimise unintentional non-flat conditions, and any visual waviness should\nbe relatively even and regular.\nThere are various causes for oil canning:\nmaterial;\nroll tool design and setting;\ninstallation; and\nexpansion allowance.\n12.4.1 \nMaterial \nAll profiled metal roof and wall products begin in a coil form. Stresses induced during coil production can\ncontribute to oil canning. Examples of these stresses are:\nFull Centre: The coil is longer in the centre of the strip than near the edges. This creates buckles and ripples in\nthe mid-coil area.\n 12 \n 12.4 OIL CANNING\n 12 \n 12.4 \n359\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nWavy Edge: The coil is longer on one edge of the strip. That causes waviness on the long edge.\nCamber: The side edge of the coil deviates from a straight line. The normal tolerance for a 1200 mm wide coil\nis a 2 mm deviation in a 2 m length, but some forming processes and end uses cannot tolerate that variation.\nUneven Material Strength: During the forming process material may tend to draw unevenly from the softer\nareas rather than evenly as designed; it leaves excessive material in the \"harder\" areas.\nSlitting: Generally, coil for flashings and narrower products are cut by slitting from a single, wider master coil.\nSlitting of a master coil can release and redistribute residual forces. It can also mean that different qualities of\nthe master coil are modified or changed in the slit coil, i.e., a full centre in a master coil can become a wavy\nedge in a slit coil and the slit coil may not retain all the attributes of the master coil or sister coils.\n12.4.2 \nTool Design \nBy the nature of the process, many stresses are created during roll forming. These must be minimised and\nequalised as much as possible during manufacturing. Forming tools must be designed to form the material\nprogressively.\nCorrugated and ribbed profiles are most often formed from the centre and moved outward thereby \"pushing\" the\ndifferential stresses to the edges of the sheet. Generally, profiled metal rib and corrugated profiles, flashings, and\nmost trough sections can be expected to provide finishes free of avoidable distortion.\nStanding seam profiles typically need more forming on the edges of the feed material and little or none in the\ncentre of the sheet, which tends to trap uneven stresses in the centre of the profile. Often one edge requires more\nforming than the other, meaning the stresses developed are not even in the sheet.\nSome evenly distributed oil canning can normally be expected in standing seam products with a width of more\nthan 300 mm, and it is considered acceptable.\n12.4.3 \nInstallation \nOil canning can occur in fixed cladding, even though it does not fit accurately, when fixings are too\nfar apart or when fixings are overdriven. It can also result from an uneven substrate, irregular\nbearing on the purlins or the structural framing being out of line.\nThermal expansion can also increase oil canning. Longitudinal expansion should be accommodated by using\nsliding clips that allow movement. See E Expansion Clips. Transverse expansion is usually accommodated in\nthe upstand of the profile, but this can only happen if adjacent pans are not in contact at the base. Wide perimeter\nflashings must be designed to allow for the independent movement of the flashing and the cladding.\nA convex curve in the roof structure can cause canning as it puts the pan of the profile under compression.\nSometimes this curve is inadvertent. Concave roof cladding and flashings give rise to oil-canning because the\npans are in compression. There are limitations on curved radii to avoid oil canning. See 15.1 Curved Roofs.\nCommercially designed truss sections and rafters may have camber induced in their manufacture, anticipating\ndeflection under load. The degree of curve that may be accommodated by any profile is largely determined by the\nwidth of the pan and is also affected by the material thickness and grade.\n 12 \n 12.4 OIL CANNING\n 12 \n 12.4 \n360\nThis is a controlled document.

All New Zealand manufacturers provide information\nabout the manufacturer, the type of coating and the manufacturing date in the branding on the\nreverse side of uncoated and colour coated steel. Double-sided coatings are not branded.\n12.5.1 \nTouch-Up \nAir-drying touch-up paints have different weathering characteristics from the baked-on finish of\npre-painted coating systems, and variations in natural light conditions will emphasise these\ndifferences, producing an unacceptable aesthetic appearance.\nSpray cans should not be used for repairing scratches on pre-painted sheeting.\nIf the scratch is obvious from 3 m, the sheeting should be replaced; if not, then it should be left alone. Minor\nsurface scratches become less noticeable as the coating weathers and are best left as they do not appreciably\naffect the corrosion-inhibiting properties of the material.\nWidespread damage caused by rough handling or an accident, however, should not be corrected by repainting;\ninstead, the affected material should be replaced.\n 12 \n 12.5 COLOUR DIFFERENTIAL\n 5 \n 12 \n 12.5 \n362\nThis is a controlled document.

Every 2 - 3 years rooflights should be inspected for damage, the condition of the\nflashings, and sealants and the fixings should be checked for tightness.\nRoof lights must not be painted over as this renders them hazardous to maintenance workers.\nBecause painted roof lights appear no different in place than metal sheets, this practice can be dangerous for any\nworkers carrying out maintenance work on the roof. Painting can also cause heat distortion which can lead to\npremature failure.\nAs a warning, primary and secondary fasteners can be brightly coloured, providing a contrast with the remainder\nof the roof cladding surrounding the roof light areas. The area can also be marked around with a distinctly painted\nstripe.\nLichen will accumulate on plastic roof lighting wherever there is a source of nutrients, but it should be removed\nwith care.

Spouting should be\nregularly cleaned to avoid the build-up of dirt and debris that can affect water quality.\nWhere a paint or paint system is applied to the roof, its suitability for the collection of drinking\nwater should be established. When rainwater from pre-painted roof cladding is used for drinking,\nit is advisable to repaint the roof as soon as its surface has weathered.\nWater collected from metal roof cladding, spouting or gutters made from aluminium, copper and\nstainless steel will not normally be contaminated by rainfall in suburban and rural areas. However,\nfallout from manufacturing plants, top dressing, and the contamination resulting from roof\ncleaning can affect the water quality, and in these cases downpipes should be disconnected.\n 12 \n 12.7 DRINKING WATER\n 7 \n 12 \n 12.7 \n364\nThis is a controlled document.

The movement that\ngenerates sound can be triggered by three main factors:\nWind.\nPrecipitation (rain, hail, or snow).\nTemperature (thermal).\nEach of these can be broken down into sub-groups.\n12.1.1 \nWind Noise \nRoof noise triggered by the wind can take several forms:\nUnderlay flutter,\nBanging of the roof itself, or things against the roof,\nVibration of flashings.\n12.1.1A Underlay Flutter\nUnderlay flutter will be perceived as a high-pitched noise. Depending on its origin, it can be minimised using\nvarious techniques, for example:\nIf it is coming from the eaves, cutting the underlay back from the spouting and installing an eaves flashing.\nIf it is coming from the body of the roof, installing a high front gutter.\nInstalling spray-on foam insulation.\n12.1.1B Wind Banging\nWind banging can be the pan drumming or banging against the sarking or purlin support. It normally only occurs\nwith standing seam profiles and it is a function of the roof design, material thickness, and wind loads. These\nproblems should be referred to the manufacturer or designer.\n12.1.1C Flashing Vibration\nExcessive movement or insufficient clearance between a penetration and the cladding may also cause noise.\nFlashing vibration can be a whistling noise or a high-pitched sound like an engine, known as motor boating. The\nedges of all flashings should have a stiffening fold and the vertical face should be fixed to the structure or wall\ncladding to avoid vibration.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n352\nThis is a controlled document.

Fleece lined\ncladding has also been found to reduce precipitation noise.\n12.1.3 \nThermal Noise \nNearly all profiled metal roofs will exhibit thermal roof noise at times. Typically, this is a relatively minor and\nuncommon event, and attracts no attention. Sometimes, however, the frequency and/or volume of the noise can\nbe to the point where it causes discomfort and distress to the occupants.\nThermal roof noise is caused by the roof expanding or contracting due to temperature fluctuation. The effect can\nbe immediate as a cloud passes over the sun or delayed as the roof and roof structure cool down at night.\nNot all materials in a roof structure absorb the same amount of heat, and not all materials have the same amount\nof thermally-induced movement. Differential movement may emanate from many places, including the layer of\nroofing exposed to the sun against layers underneath (i.e. a flashing or lap), the roof profile against the fastener,\nor the roof against the support structure. It can also happen when expansion of the roof causes one member of\nthe support structure directly to move against another. Movement may also occur as sudden popping in the pan\nof a profile that releases static friction and causes sound.\nThe source of thermal roof noise can be difficult to identify in many cases. However, roof noise can be divided\ninto three main categories by source. They are:\nFlashings,\npopping of pan, and\nother causes of thermal noise.\nFlashings\nWhere flashings are solid fixed to a vertical surface and to the cladding, differential movement between them and\nthe roof may cause noise. Using clip-fastened systems allowing flashings and roofing to move independently to\neach other will help minimise noise associated with this movement.\nPan Popping\nOil canning, or canning, is the term used to describe visible waviness of the pan of a metal roof. It is most\nnoticeable in roofs with wide trays but may also occur in secret fixed or trapezoidal profiles.\nPan popping is accompanied by canning, but not all canning jobs result in thermal roof noise. Canning is most\nprevalent in tray profiles, but popping roof noise is most often found with trapezoidal or secret fixed roofs.\nCanning can be minimised by good rollformer tooling design and adjustment, but it can also be exacerbated by\nvariations in mechanical properties and shape of the coil.\nEven steel coil well within standard tolerances can have characteristics that lead to high levels of canning in\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n353\nThis is a controlled document.

The exact source of most\nroof noise is hard to identify.\nA common observation of noisy roofs is poor contact between the purlin and the rafter due to insufficient\npressure being put on the purlin when installing purlin screws, allowing the purlin to ride up on the thread. It may\ncreate a source of noise as purlins rotate under thermal expansion forces. Purlin screws should have a length of\nunthreaded shank below the head of at least the purlin thickness.\n12.1.3A Poor Purlin-to-Rafter Connection\nIt is impossible to prevent expansion, but its effects can be minimised.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n354\nThis is a controlled document.

Lowering roof\ntemperatures minimises thermal noise. Increasing ventilation in the ceiling cavity is the easiest way to lower roof\ntemperatures and may have the added benefit of lowering roof space humidity.\nThe accumulation of stress can be minimised by avoiding excessive run lengths. Friction can be reduced by using\nlow-friction underlay and using oversized fastener holes to allow materials to move freely. Fasteners should be\nchecked for over-tightening and eased if necessary.\nMany roof noise problems are typically associated with long, low, dark skillion roofs, but some noisy roofs have\nnone of those design features. To date, the MRM have not recorded any instances of thermal roof noise with\nroofs fastened to steel purlins or frames.\nThermal roof noise is a modern problem. Although often attributed to the roof material, steel and the profiles we\nform it into have not changed. In one case, a noisy trapezoidal roof was replaced with a corrugated roof\nmanufactured from imported material, and the noise problem remained.\nChanges that have occurred in the industry include:\nroofs are screwed on rather than nailed,\nroofs are longer and darker,\npurlins are screw fastened not nailed,\nhouses are more airtight and far better insulated,\ntrusses have largely replaced rafters, and\nframing timber is lighter and younger.\nIt is possible that a number of these aspects contribute in complex ways to produce varying thermal expansion\nnoise levels, but we certainly don't want to go back to nailed roofs and uninsulated houses.\nThe exact source of much roof noise is still a mystery. Auckland University is currently researching a scientific\napproach to identifying causes and solutions to roof noise.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n355\nThis is a controlled document.

They are:\nFlashings,\npopping of pan, and\nother causes of thermal noise.\nFlashings\nWhere flashings are solid fixed to a vertical surface and to the cladding, differential movement between them and\nthe roof may cause noise. Using clip-fastened systems allowing flashings and roofing to move independently to\neach other will help minimise noise associated with this movement.\nPan Popping\nOil canning, or canning, is the term used to describe visible waviness of the pan of a metal roof. It is most\nnoticeable in roofs with wide trays but may also occur in secret fixed or trapezoidal profiles.\nPan popping is accompanied by canning, but not all canning jobs result in thermal roof noise. Canning is most\nprevalent in tray profiles, but popping roof noise is most often found with trapezoidal or secret fixed roofs.\nCanning can be minimised by good rollformer tooling design and adjustment, but it can also be exacerbated by\nvariations in mechanical properties and shape of the coil.\nEven steel coil well within standard tolerances can have characteristics that lead to high levels of canning in\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n353\nThis is a controlled document.

The exact source of most\nroof noise is hard to identify.\nA common observation of noisy roofs is poor contact between the purlin and the rafter due to insufficient\npressure being put on the purlin when installing purlin screws, allowing the purlin to ride up on the thread. It may\ncreate a source of noise as purlins rotate under thermal expansion forces. Purlin screws should have a length of\nunthreaded shank below the head of at least the purlin thickness.\nIt is impossible to prevent expansion, but its effects can be minimised.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n354\nThis is a controlled document.

Lowering roof\ntemperatures minimises thermal noise. Increasing ventilation in the ceiling cavity is the easiest way to lower roof\ntemperatures and may have the added benefit of lowering roof space humidity.\nThe accumulation of stress can be minimised by avoiding excessive run lengths. Friction can be reduced by using\nlow-friction underlay and using oversized fastener holes to allow materials to move freely. Fasteners should be\nchecked for over-tightening and eased if necessary.\nMany roof noise problems are typically associated with long, low, dark skillion roofs, but some noisy roofs have\nnone of those design features. To date, the MRM have not recorded any instances of thermal roof noise with\nroofs fastened to steel purlins or frames.\nThermal roof noise is a modern problem. Although often attributed to the roof material, steel and the profiles we\nform it into have not changed. In one case, a noisy trapezoidal roof was replaced with a corrugated roof\nmanufactured from imported material, and the noise problem remained.\nChanges that have occurred in the industry include:\nroofs are screwed on rather than nailed,\nroofs are longer and darker,\npurlins are screw fastened not nailed,\nhouses are more airtight and far better insulated,\ntrusses have largely replaced rafters, and\nframing timber is lighter and younger.\nIt is possible that a number of these aspects contribute in complex ways to produce varying thermal expansion\nnoise levels, but we certainly don't want to go back to nailed roofs and uninsulated houses.\nThe exact source of much roof noise is still a mystery. Auckland University is currently researching a scientific\napproach to identifying causes and solutions to roof noise.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 12.1 ROOF NOISE\n 1 \n 12 \n 12.1 \n355\nThis is a controlled document.

Flat pan architectural metal panels, wide flashings, and profiled metal cladding with wide\npan configurations without stiffening ribs are all liable to show distortion in flat metal areas. It is known as oil-\ncanning or panning.\nOil canning can be defined as visible waviness in the flat areas of metal roofing and wall cladding. It can also be\nreferred to as panning, canning, stress wrinkling or elastic buckling, and is caused by differential stresses in the\nmetal. As the metal tries to relieve these stresses in panels with high width to thickness ratios, material buckles\nout of plane producing the characteristic waviness of oil canning\nIt has an aesthetic effect and is not a structural or durability issue. Some highly reflective paint finishes and\nmetals or different light conditions can exacerbate the visual effect of oil canning. Some distortion is inevitable in\nlight gauges. It can become an issue of customer acceptance because customer expectations are often\nunrealistically high.\nThe degree of waviness can be hard to measure and is highly dependent on viewing angles, the position of the\nsun, and the reflectivity of the surface. Cladding installations with a high degree of visibility should be designed to\nminimise oil canning.\nOil canning is more common where the width of unformed sections is large. It can usually be avoided or\nminimised in normal rib and trough section profiles with a maximum pan width of 300 mm, and flashings that\nhave a maximum unformed width of 300 mm. See 8.1 Flashing Materials\nIn standing seam roofs with pan widths of more than 300 mm, some oil canning is normally evident. Many\ndesigners regard oil canning in such profiles as inherent to the material and treat it as a desired effect\naccentuating the material's natural characteristics.\nManufacturers and installers should minimise unintentional non-flat conditions, and any visual waviness should\nbe relatively even and regular.\nThere are various causes for oil canning:\nmaterial;\nroll tool design and setting;\ninstallation; and\nexpansion allowance.\n12.4.1 \nMaterial \nAll profiled metal roof and wall products begin in a coil form. Stresses induced during coil production can\ncontribute to oil canning. Examples of these stresses are:\nFull Centre: The coil is longer in the centre of the strip than near the edges. This creates buckles and ripples in\nthe mid-coil area.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 12 \n 12.4 \n359\nThis is a controlled document.

That causes waviness on the long edge.\nCamber: The side edge of the coil deviates from a straight line. The normal tolerance for a 1200 mm wide coil\nis a 2 mm deviation in a 2 m length, but some forming processes and end uses cannot tolerate that variation.\nUneven Material Strength: During the forming process material may tend to draw unevenly from the softer\nareas rather than evenly as designed; it leaves excessive material in the \"harder\" areas.\nSlitting: Generally, coil for flashings and narrower products are cut by slitting from a single, wider master coil.\nSlitting of a master coil can release and redistribute residual forces. It can also mean that different qualities of\nthe master coil are modified or changed in the slit coil, i.e., a full centre in a master coil can become a wavy\nedge in a slit coil and the slit coil may not retain all the attributes of the master coil or sister coils.\n12.4.2 \nTool Design \nBy the nature of the process, many stresses are created during roll forming. These must be minimised and\nequalised as much as possible during manufacturing. Forming tools must be designed to form the material\nprogressively.\nCorrugated and ribbed profiles are most often formed from the centre and moved outward thereby \"pushing\" the\ndifferential stresses to the edges of the sheet. Generally, profiled metal rib and corrugated profiles, flashings, and\nmost trough sections can be expected to provide finishes free of avoidable distortion.\nStanding seam profiles typically need more forming on the edges of the feed material and little or none in the\ncentre of the sheet, which tends to trap uneven stresses in the centre of the profile. Often one edge requires more\nforming than the other, meaning the stresses developed are not even in the sheet.\nSome evenly distributed oil canning can normally be expected in standing seam products with a width of more\nthan 300 mm, and it is considered acceptable.\n12.4.3 \nInstallation \nOil canning can occur in fixed cladding, even though it does not fit accurately, when fixings are too\nfar apart or when fixings are overdriven. It can also result from an uneven substrate, irregular\nbearing on the purlins or the structural framing being out of line.\nThermal expansion can also increase oil canning. Longitudinal expansion should be accommodated by using\nsliding clips that allow movement. See E Expansion Clips. Transverse expansion is usually accommodated in\nthe upstand of the profile, but this can only happen if adjacent pans are not in contact at the base. Wide perimeter\nflashings must be designed to allow for the independent movement of the flashing and the cladding.\nA convex curve in the roof structure can cause canning as it puts the pan of the profile under compression.\nSometimes this curve is inadvertent.

See 15.1 Curved Roofs.\nCommercially designed truss sections and rafters may have camber induced in their manufacture, anticipating\ndeflection under load.

            "content": "Wavy Edge: The coil is longer on one edge of the strip. That causes waviness on the long edge.\nCamber: The side edge of the coil deviates from a straight line. The normal tolerance for a 1200 mm wide coil\nis a 2 mm deviation in a 2 m length, but some forming processes and end uses cannot tolerate that variation.\nUneven Material Strength: During the forming process material may tend to draw unevenly from the softer\nareas rather than evenly as designed; it leaves excessive material in the \"harder\" areas.\nSlitting: Generally, coil for flashings and narrower products are cut by slitting from a single, wider master coil.\nSlitting of a master coil can release and redistribute residual forces. It can also mean that different qualities of\nthe master coil are modified or changed in the slit coil, i.e., a full centre in a master coil can become a wavy\nedge in a slit coil and the slit coil may not retain all the attributes of the master coil or sister coils.\n12.4.2 \nTool Design \nBy the nature of the process, many stresses are created during roll forming. These must be minimised and\nequalised as much as possible during manufacturing. Forming tools must be designed to form the material\nprogressively.\nCorrugated and ribbed profiles are most often formed from the centre and moved outward thereby \"pushing\" the\ndifferential stresses to the edges of the sheet. Generally, profiled metal rib and corrugated profiles, flashings, and\nmost trough sections can be expected to provide finishes free of avoidable distortion.\nStanding seam profiles typically need more forming on the edges of the feed material and little or none in the\ncentre of the sheet, which tends to trap uneven stresses in the centre of the profile. Often one edge requires more\nforming than the other, meaning the stresses developed are not even in the sheet.\nSome evenly distributed oil canning can normally be expected in standing seam products with a width of more\nthan 300 mm, and it is considered acceptable.\n12.4.3 \nInstallation \nOil canning can occur in fixed cladding, even though it does not fit accurately, when fixings are too\nfar apart or when fixings are overdriven. It can also result from an uneven substrate, irregular\nbearing on the purlins or the structural framing being out of line.\nThermal expansion can also increase oil canning. Longitudinal expansion should be accommodated by using\nsliding clips that allow movement. See E Expansion Clips. Transverse expansion is usually accommodated in\nthe upstand of the profile, but this can only happen if adjacent pans are not in contact at the base. Wide perimeter\nflashings must be designed to allow for the independent movement of the flashing and the cladding.\nA convex curve in the roof structure can cause canning as it puts the pan of the profile under compression.\nSometimes this curve is inadvertent. Concave roof cladding and flashings give rise to oil-canning because the\npans are in compression. There are limitations on curved radii to avoid oil canning. See 15.1 Curved Roofs.\nCommercially designed truss sections and rafters may have camber induced in their manufacture, anticipating\ndeflection under load. The degree of curve that may be accommodated by any profile is largely determined by the\nwidth of the pan and is also affected by the material thickness and grade.\n 12 FITNESS FOR PURPOSE\n 12 \n 12.4 OIL CANNING\n 12 \n 12.4 \n360\nThis is a controlled document.

Any decisions departing from it should be agreed on and written\nconfirmation signed before work begins. \nMinor changes should be recorded by the council on the consent application, major changes must be approved by\nthe council before execution.\nWhere specific details are not drawn, the roofer and the main contractor should agree on the execution of these\ndetails before commencement.\nThe roofing contractor is required to have safety provisions in place that satisfy the HSW Act before work is\ncommenced\nThe supporting structure should be inspected; the purlins and girts should be checked to see they are in a true\nplane and securely fixed, all trimming completed for penetrations, and any work by other trades is completed.\nWhere roof and wall cladding intersect with other materials, the sequencing of work and responsibilities for\nweatherproofing must be agreed upon with the main contractor prior to installation.\n 14 \n 14.1 PRE-INSTALLATION\n 1 \n 14 \n 14.1 \n374\nThis is a controlled document.

See 4 Durability.\nAluminium requires special installation details to achieve durability. See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium\nSheeting for more details.\n14.2.1 \nMeasuring \nMeasuring should take place once sufficient structure is in place to enable accurate calculation of lengths\nrequired. It is beneficial to make more than one measurement of any run to identify discrepancies and avoid\nerrors.\n14.2.2 \nOrdering \nCladding materials should be ordered with enough time to allow for manufacture and transport. Profile, thickness,\ncolour, grade, and any requirements for labelling of bundles should all be clearly identified.\nDo not mix products; different manufacturers use different paint formulations. Where different brands of pre-\npainted material are used on the same building, differences in colour, gloss, and weathering performance may\nappear immediately or over time.\n14.2.3 \nTransportation \nLoad safety and protection is primarily the driver's responsibility.\nShort sheets should be packed on top of longer ones, which should have end and edge protection to avoid cut-\nend damage to the sheets below them. Dunnage should be evenly spaced in vertical alignment. Bundles must be\nplaced and secured to protect against damage from other materials.\nFor sheets that are exposed on the underside in situ, such as for unlined wall cladding applications, or have\ndouble-sided or fleece-lined coatings, protection must be given to prevent the dunnage from damaging the bottom\nsheet.

If there is any concern\nabout the condition of the product, the supplier should be contacted before installation commences.\nEnsure all components needed to complete the installation, including fasteners and accessories, are onsite\nbefore commencing installation.\n14.3.1 \nUnloading \nSet out a flat area and supporting dunnage to ensure sheets will not be damaged by site debris.\nWhen unloading by crane, ensure the lifting boom has a spreader bar and that tightening strops do not damage\nsheet laps. Slings or strops should be nylon with leather sleeves to prevent fraying or cutting and\ndamaging slings. Single slings and chains should not be used to lift packs of cladding.\n14.3.1A Sling with Spreader Bar\nSpreader\nWhen unloading by hand, lift each sheet off the stack without sliding over under sheets, as that may cause\ndamage to the paint.\nThe person receiving the roof is responsible for identifying a safe and convenient landing point for the load, in\nassociation with the main contractor. The mobile or truck mounted crane operator has the duty of declining any\nloading instruction which he deems unsafe. Under no conditions should the load be traversed directly above any\nperson\nBundles or packs of roof cladding must remain banded when being lifted by a crane.\nThey must be placed adjacent to the portal frame and not mid-span on the purlins. Bundles must be\nplaced so that their weight is spread over the entire area of the roof and should be positioned with the\nlaps in the direction of laying.\nWorkers receiving a bundle of roof cladding on the roof must have sufficient mobility to avoid the load,\nand use tag lines to control the swinging of the load while it is out of reach.\n 14 \n 14.3 ACCEPTING DELIVERY\n 3 \n 14 \n 14.3 \n377\nThis is a controlled document.

This happens because the metal exposed\nto moisture without air forms bulky, unstable, and loosely adherent, hygroscopic compounds. See 4.10.7\nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain.\nWater can infiltrate deeply into a bundle of close-stacked sheets. The extent and severity of wet storage stain is\nusually proportional to the time the sheeting has been wet, however, the time to onset can be very variable, and\noccur more rapidly in warm conditions. \nSheets can be dried by filleting sheets or cross-stacking them on a slope to allow water to drain and air to\ncirculate between them. Only use a dry, well-ventilated environment for long-term storage.\nA patchy visual appearance of the paint can also result from wet stack storage of pre-painted steel products. This\nis known as blooming.\nBlooming results from water swelling the paint and flattening or suppressing gloss components. The gloss\ndistortion is typically temporary and will dissipate with time, and exposure to heat/sunlight. This can be\ndemonstrated by the application of boiling water to an affected surface bringing the appearance back to normal\n 14 \n 14.3 ACCEPTING DELIVERY\n 3 \n 14 \n 14.3 \n378\nThis is a controlled document.

The information must indicate the positions on the sheet where persons may\nsafely walk or stand without causing damage or, alternatively, indicate the necessity to provide\ntemporary walkways.\nFor roofs tested in accordance with MRM testing standards, see 17.1 Metal Cladding Testing. A Restricted\nAccess roof will withstand a 100 kg point load applied to the rib or over two pans, and an Unrestricted Access\nroof will withstand a 100 kg point load to a single rib at mid span. It must be taken into account that a worker\nladen with tools may weigh more than 100 kg, and impact loads can also contribute to exceeding this limit.\nWhen access to the roof is necessary after construction, it is best practice to step in the pan of the profile\nwhen walking up the roof, and follow purlin lines when traversing roofs.\n14.5A Walking in the Pan\nIf the ribs are too close together, so workers cannot place their feet in the pan, their weight must be\nspread evenly over at least two ribs when walking up the roof.\n14.5B Spreading Weight over two Ribs\n 14 \n 14.5 WALKING ON ROOFS\n 5 \n 14 \n 14.5 \n381\nThis is a controlled document.

It is not designed to protect against corrosion, humidity, or chemicals.\nStrippable film must be removed before prolonged exposure to sunlight, as that may make it extremely difficult to\nremove. Prolonged exposure and wet conditions can also cause the film adhesive to whiten and breakdown,\nleaving residue on the painted surface when the film is removed. Once removed from the sheet for installation,\nstrippable film must be collected and removed from the site.\n14.6.1 \nStoring Product with Strippable Film \nProduct with film applied must be stored at temperatures of less than 50 deg C and out of direct sunlight to avoid\nprolonged UV exposure.\nThe product needs to be kept dry to prevent moisture ingress between the film and the painted surface. In the\nlong term moisture ingress may cause issues to the painted surface; and in the shorter term cause the film\nadhesive to whiten and breakdown, leaving residue on the painted surface when the film is removed.\n 14 \n 14.6 STRIPPABLE FILMS\n 6 \n 14 \n 14.6 \n383\nThis is a controlled document.

If the\nremaining area of a roof or wall section to be covered is less than a standard sheet width, the sheet should be cut\nlengthwise to fit the gap.\nSimilarly, when replacing a roof without removing existing flashings, for example, apron or chimney flashings\nbehind cladding, the area of the retained flashing should be reduced by cutting back to the minimum practically\nachievable.\nIf a roof sheet lap requires extra protection, for instance, when over the apex of a barrel curved roof where pitch is\nless than the minimum stipulated for the product, laps should be sealed rather than double-lapped. Lap tape is\npreferred over gunned sealant for this purpose, as it is less likely to become displaced while positioning the\nsheet.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BDL01 Double Lapping Roofing Sheets\nExtract:\n\"...The side laps of roofing sheets are designed to allow enough drying and air access to prevent wet\nstorage damage.

It is not\nnecessary to face laps away from prevailing wind direction as roofs must be designed to withstand weather from\nany quarter. On critical jobs or when using curved sheets, it is advisable that side laps face away from the line of\nsight.\nSheets should be laid square to the nearest architectural feature, and regularly checked to correct any\nmisalignment of sheet or squareness of structure. Laying out of square will result in saw-toothing of the eaves\nline. Saw-toothing of greater than 5 mm may be trimmed back to form a straight line.\n 14 \n 14.8 SETTING OUT\n 8 \n 14 \n 14.8 \n385\nThis is a controlled document.

The\ncarbon in the pencil promotes corrosion, which will etch the surface of the material, leaving a permanent mark.\nUse a pencil of any colour other than black, a marker pen, or a crayon.\nCut pre-painted steel material with care to avoid marring the high-quality finish. Cut by shear only - use nibblers\nor hand shears. Friction blades and high-speed saw blades must not be used on metal cladding. These blades will\ndamage both the metallic coating and the pre-painted steel surface by creating excessive heat, and generate large\namounts of hot swarf, which will get embedded into the coating surface\nAll debris must be swept off the job at the end of each day. Prevention of swarf damage is far easier than its cure.\n(See 14.18.4.1 Preventing Swarf Damage).\n 14 \n 14.9 MARKING AND CUTTING\n 9 \n 14 \n 14.9 \n386\nThis is a controlled document.

When the ends are not\nbaffled by spouting, the recommended minimum is 70 mm.\n14.10A Minimum Overhang\n Underlay must not overhang the fascia by more than 20 mm or, if eaves flashings are used, terminate on the\nupper side of the flashing.

When unavoidable, the end lap of should be\nsealed with a double bead of sealant as in the illustration below. Alternatively, self- adhesive closed cell tape can\nbe used in the same position.\n14.11.1A Sealed End Lap\n14.11.2 \nSide Laps \nSide laps should be fitted evenly and snugly without excessive gaps or tension. Sheets exhibiting edge wave\nshould be reported to the supplier immediately. Where a sheet width exceeds the distance to the next\narchitectural feature, it should be slit to width; not given multiple overlaps to decrease its effective cover width.\nThis will prevent water being\ndrawn up by capillary action\nSeal top edge of lap to prevent\ningress of condensation.\nPotential corrosion area\n 14 \n 14.11 SEALING AND JOINING\n 11 \n 14 \n 14.11 \n388\nThis is a controlled document.

Fasteners used pre-painted steel products\nshould be factory colour matched before installation.\n14.12.1 \nNails \nThe traditional New Zealand roof fastener was, until 1980, the \"Lead Head\", a flat-headed smooth\nshank steel nail with a lead head cast on it. Lead heads often 'backed out', causing leaks, the\nshanks were prone to corrosion, and lead is incompatible with modern metallic coatings.\nSpiral Shank nail fasteners have a galvanised shank, and the spiral shank has over twice the\nwithdrawal resistance of a smooth shanked nail. They are however still prone to backing out, and\nthe under-head seal is not as robust as the neoprene seals used on modern roofing screws.\nThe COP recommends using screws rather than driven fasteners, in all cases.\n14.12.1A Nail Pull-out\nDriven Fasteners can back out over time.\n14.12.2 \nScrews \nScrew fasteners should be long enough to give adequate penetration into the supporting structure. Generally,\n30 mm embedment is required for screws into timber or three threads engagement for screws into steel. Refer to\nroofing manufacturers for specific recommendations.\n 14 \n 14.12 FASTENERS\n 12 \n 14 \n 14.12 \n389\nThis is a controlled document.

These profiles offer the advantages of fewer penetrations through the cladding, and thermal expansion is\nunimpeded.\nClip and bracket fasteners can be purpose made to provide the same attributes to most flashings.\n14.12.4 \nRivets \nRivets should have a minimum diameter of 4 mm.\nUse aluminium rivets for galvanised sheets and aluminium/zinc-coated steel products; monel rivets are\nincompatible with aluminium and zinc products.\nSealed rivets are preferred over unsealed rivets, as they do not require adding sealant on the face to achieve\nweatherproofing.\n14.12.4A Rivet Setting\nJaws\nMandrel\nMandre\nMandrel head\nAfter setting\nBlind rivets are placed through a pre-drilled hole then are set by rivet tool withdrawing the mandrel.

Resilient\nwashers under fastener heads will only seal properly with the right adjustment.\n14.13A Depth Setting\nDrilling and\nthread forming\nCorrect \nsealing\nIncorrect \nsealing\nThree threads\nExperienced operators can, in most instances, drive screws correctly by using a variable speed screw gun;\nhowever, a depth set gun will give more consistent results.\nType 17 screws driven into timber will 'part' the fibres rather than cutting them which provides a self-locking\naction against withdrawal. Screws driven completely through timber will, therefore, not have the same pull-out\nresistance as screws with embedded tips.\nImpact drivers and poorly fitting nut drivers can both damage the protective coating on the screw head which will\naffect durability. It is the roofer's responsibility to ensure the method of installing screws does not cause\ndamage.\nScrew points, method of driving, and thread design all have an impact on pull-out capacity; so in critical\nsituations, the specific screw and method of installation must be specified.\n14.13.1 \nFastener Spacing \nFasteners should be of grade and type suitable for the application, installed at spacings required by design loads\nand manufacturer's recommendations.\nOn buildings constructed to NZS 3604, a consistent fixing pattern should be used on all fastener rows; for other\nbuildings, higher fastener density may be required around the periphery. All purlins must be fastened to so that\nthey each contribute to resisting uplift loads. See 3.9 Fastener Requirements and Overhangs.\nRivets on flashings should be placed at 50 mm centres.\n14.13.2 \nFastener Placement \n 14 \n 14.13 FASTENER INSTALLATION\n 13 \n 14 \n 14.13 \n393\nThis is a controlled document.

Wall cladding fasteners can be placed at the\ncrest or the pan. Pan fixing of wall cladding is more popular as the screw lines are less visible.\nN.B. The pullover design values established by testing for pan fixing are more than twice those for crest\nfixing.\n14.13.3 \nFastener Seating \nFasteners should be seated snugly to give a good seal, without distorting the roofing profile. Any \"pigtails\"\ncreated by the drilling process must be removed before seating the screw.\n14.13.4 \nFastener Allowance for Expansion \nAll roofing and cladding are subject to expansion and contraction due to temperature extremes. This is\nparticularly evident with darker colours and long spans where the expansion may be as much as 8 mm for a 10 m\nsheet. Screws fitted with profiled washers to allow for thermal expansion must be installed centrally through a\n9 mm diameter pre-drilled hole in the roof sheeting.\n 14 \n 14.13 FASTENER INSTALLATION\n 13 \n 14 \n 14.13 \n394\nThis is a controlled document.

Where profiled load spreading washers are\nrequired to eliminate this, it is important that the specified washer is used. When fastening to light gauge steel\npurlins, thread strip out may be the lower failure point. The pull-out failure point is very dependent on drill point,\nthread shape, and pitch; it is essential in such cases to use a correctly specified fastener.\n14.14A Pull-Over\n14.14B Pull Out\n14.14C Thread Strip Out\n14.14D Back Out\n 14 \n 14.14 MODES OF FASTENER FAILURE\n 14 \n 14 \n 14.14 \n395\nThis is a controlled document.

Stop-ends for trapezoidal and\ncorrugate profiles can only be of the pull-up type. Where the stop-end cannot be full height because of the profile\ndesign or is purposely left low to facilitate ventilation, the height of the stop-end must be at least 25mm.\nThe stop-end tool should be a proprietary tool designed for the product being used, with chamfered edges to\nminimise damage to the coating. Stop-ends to high tensile trough sections can typically only be effectively\nformed to the height of the S-bend in the rib.\nStop ending can distort the pan adjacent to the turn-up. Techniques such as standing in the pan being formed and\nsupporting the pan on a flat surface can minimise this but it is difficult to eliminate, particularly with wide pans\nand high-tensile material. \nThe cover of over flashings should be sufficient to minimise water ponding caused by deformation during the\nstop-ending process. Deformation of the pan will also cause variation in the gap between notched flashings and\nthe profile. Variations in the gap are acceptable, but contact with the edge of the flashing and the pan of the\nprofile must be avoided.\n14.15A Dog-eared Stop-ends\nA 'dog-eared' or full stop-end is made by cutting the rib back to the height of the profile so the material can be\ndressed and \"wrapped around\" 90 deg . It is not possible to dog-ear stop-end many profiles because of the shape of\ntheir rib.\nTo create dog-eared stop-ends:\nSlit all ribs to a length equivalent to their height.\nCut away the tops of the ribs at a slight upwards angle and remove.\n 14 \n 14.15 STOP-ENDS\n 15 \n 14 \n 14.15 \n396\nThis is a controlled document.

No\nextra material allowance is required for a 'pull-up' stop-end. \n14.15C Corrugate Stop-ends\nStop-ends for corrugate should be pulled up to the full height of the profile, and on low pitches at exposed sites,\nadditional weathering may be provided by the use of filler blocks.

There should be a gap between\nthe downturn and the adjacent rib to prevent capillary action and to allow for pressure equalisation. Both vertical\nand horizontal faces of the flashing should be fastened to other cladding or preferably, through the cladding to the\nstructure.\nTransverse flashings may be notched over the ribs of the profile, or for lower trapezoidal profiles or corrugate\nthey can be fitted with a soft edging which is dressed into the pan of the profile. All soft edging must be colour\nmatched to the roof before installation. Soft edging can be solid aluminium, solidly backed, or perforated to allow\nventilation. The leading edge of transverse flashings must be through fastened to the primary structure, not\nriveted to the cladding.\n 14 \n 14.17 SOFT EDGING AND FLASHING\n 17 \n 14 \n 14.17 \n399\nThis is a controlled document.

If this is unacceptable, roofs should be designed to Unrestricted Access criteria and roof access and\nusage by other trades should be strongly managed and supervised.\n A small ding in a sheet will not normally cause any structural problems and may be aesthetically acceptable;\nhowever, deeper dings can cause cracking of the sheet and lead to leaks.\nTo restore a damaged rib load capability to the original levels, all damage must be repaired with a cap flashing.\nFor aesthetic reasons, any damage may be unacceptable. However, if the roof cladding is not visible, ribs can be\nrepaired by using a sealed and riveted saddle cap.\n14.18.1A Sealed and Riveted Saddle\nSeal and rivet\nThis ding must also be repaired\nIt is technically acceptable to have two dings or creases on one sheet within one purlin spacing, providing two\nadjacent ribs are not damaged. Any greater level of damage requires the sheets to be replaced, and the person\nwho causes the damage must report it and be responsible for its repair.\n14.18.2 \nWater Ponding \n 14 \n 14.18 AVOIDING PROBLEMS\n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n400\nThis is a controlled document.

Ponding will detract from a\ncoated steel product's life and will invalidate the product warranty.\nThe installation of penetrations must be done in such a way that they do not cause ponding. See External\nMoisture: Penetrations.\nOn low pitched roofs, careless or excessive foot traffic may cause rib damage and localised ponding. This can be\nminimised by installing temporary protection in critical areas, such as entry points, where the roof is accessed by\nother trades, or there is a step-down in the roof. It is the main contractor's responsibility to ensure that other\ntrades do not damage the roof.\nIt is recommended to design to Unrestricted Access-criteria or better if roofs are highly visible or need to be\nregularly accessed by maintenance personnel.\n14.18.3 \nCorrectly Installed Gutters \nGutters must be installed with adequate fall to ensure water is transported to appropriately located downpipes.\nFalls and joints should be constructed so that water does not pond to a depth of more than 5 mm. Regular gutter\ncleaning and maintenance are required to remove leaves and other debris that may restrict water flow to\ndownpipes. Vertical downpipes are parallel to the wall and adjacent vertical references, such as window jambs.\nA gutter protection system (or any other product) that entraps debris or water between itself and any steel\nproduct surfaces, restricting coated steel's ability to dry, is not recommended and is an exclusion in the product\nwarranty.\n14.18.3A Incorrectly Installed Gutter Protection System\n14.18.4 \nSwarf Damage \nSwarf is the term given to the metal debris arising from cutting or piercing operations when using friction saws,\ndrills, or other tools on roofing and cladding products.

These stains are often mistaken for early deterioration of the roofing and cladding itself.\nSee 4.14 Swarf Staining and Cut Edge Corrosion.\n14.18.4.1 \nPreventing Swarf Damage \nCutting\nCut only by shear; power shears or hand snips produce the least amount of debris.\nPower nibblers give a clean cut but generate debris which if left is prone to corrosion.\nDo not use metal friction blades or reciprocating saws which produce fine hot particles which can embed\ndeeply into the coating surface and corrode rapidly.\nIf metal grinding is taking place near the surface of an installed or uninstalled roof, careful masking of nearby\ncoated steel surfaces must be executed.\nClean-up\nSwarf should be swept or hosed from the job progressively and certainly no less than at the end of each day.\nSwarf that has become stuck must be removed carefully, avoiding action which is likely to remove or change the\nappearance of the paint or metal coatings.\nWhen sweeping or hosing into a gutter, clean out the gutter before leaving the job to prevent premature corrosion.\nOn completion of the job, give a final wash or sweep down.\n14.18.4.2 \nSevere or Extensive Swarf Staining \nIf the coating is severely damaged by swarf corrosion, the area should be painted or replaced. The whole visible\narea should be repaired, as air drying paints weather more rapidly and in a different manner to pre-painted roofing\nand cladding products. If swarf particles are painted over, rust bleed-through is likely to occur.\n14.18.4.3 \nSupervising Other Trades \nA common cause of swarf complaints arises because other trades have used grinding equipment in\nthe vicinity of a newly completed roof. Wind carried swarf can contaminate large areas some\ndistance from the cutting site. Main contractors should be aware of the likelihood of such damage,\nand project planning should include scheduling of all cutting or grinding work to be completed\nbefore laying the roof cladding.\n14.18.5 \nColour Matching Paint \n 14 \n 14.18 AVOIDING PROBLEMS\n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n402\nThis is a controlled document.

The term touch-up paint should never be used. Fasteners and accessories requiring\ncolour matching should be painted before installation.\nAir-dried paints used to disguise marks weather at a rate different from that of pre-painted material, sometimes\ndramatically so, and will often become more apparent than the mark they are intended to disguise. Minor\nscratches are best left alone, and they will not affect the performance of the pre-painted product due to the self-\nhealing qualities of the primer and metallic coating. They become less evident as the coating weathers.\nMinor scratches may be described as scratches that do not extend to the metallic coating, are less than 3 mm in\nwidth, and are not visually noticeable from a distance of 3 m. This characterisation will, however, vary with the\nconcentration of the scratches, and the visibility of the area affected.\nExtensive coating damage to any pre-painted steel product can only be rectified by replacement or repainting of\nthe affected sheets.\n14.18.5A Visual Impact of Mismatched Paint\n14.18.6 \nField Painting \n 14 \n 14.18 AVOIDING PROBLEMS\n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n403\nThis is a controlled document.

Metallic coated roofs can be painted immediately after installation; however, dirt, grease, and any loose\nmaterials must be cleaned off, so the surface is clean and dry before applying the first coat.\nAn effective method for painting metallic coated roofing is to apply a good quality galvanised iron primer and two\nwater-based acrylic topcoats, following the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPre-painted products can be painted after exposure to weather. Normally, 6-12 months of exposure is required to\nachieve surface modification of the surface to allow the new coating to adhere.\nEdge laps of unpainted metallic coated sheets steel do not require lap priming.\n14.18.7 \nSunscreen \nSunscreen containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide can accelerate the degradation of organic materials including\nauto finishes and pre-painted cladding surfaces. This damage is irreparable, so prevention of its occurrence is the\nonly defence.

However,\nto acquire the required fastener durability, use aluminium or stainless screws rather than painted steel screws.\nAluminium screws require pre-drilled pilot holes into the purlin.\nAluminium has approximately twice the thermal expansion of steel, therefore, expansion provisions must be\nexecuted as for steel of twice the length.\nBeing soft and frequently requiring oversize holes for expansion, aluminium is typically fastened with fasteners\nequipped with load spreading washers, as is reflected in published span tables. Installers must adhere to\npublished fastening systems to meet design load/span expectations.\n14.19A Fixing Aluminium \nGutter front height \nabove rib level at \neaves\nSolid soffit or \nceiling lining\nAluminium \neaves flashing\nAluminium or stainless \nsteel fasteners through \nover sized holes\nProfiled aluminium \nwasher\nStainless steel \nstaples\nPurlins clear of \nexposed steel \nfasteners\nNon-corrosive underlay suppor\n14.19.1 \nPainted Aluminium \nPainted aluminium products perform differently than uncoated aluminium as the paint coating affects reactions\nwith the atmosphere, and reduces the aluminium surface area that can be sacrificed to defend against localised\ncorrosion.\nPitted corrosion can result from damage to the paint coating and exposure to corrosive substances. It is\nnecessary to protect against wet contact with concrete, treated timber, steel, stainless steel, and butyl rubber.\n14.19.2 \nRecommendations for Fixing Aluminium \na.\nThe front edge of the spouting or gutter must be higher than the crest of the roofing profile.\nb.\nEaves flashings of painted or unpainted aluminium must be used.

If present, it\nmust be separated by a 5 mm non-compressible barrier of inert, non-absorbent, non-reactive material.\nAlternatively, self-supporting underlays may be used. Plastic strapping can be used for supporting\nunderlays, stapled with stainless steel staples to the vertical face of the purlins.\ne.\nIn a wet environment, aluminium must be separated from a corrosive surface such as concrete, butyl\nrubber, or CCA-treated timber by using a 5 mm rigid strip of an inert non-absorbent material, an open woven\ngeotextile layer, or PVC netting. Plastic-coated steel netting is not recommended under aluminium\nsheeting.\nf.\nThe design of the ceiling cavity must prevent the saturation of support members from internal or ground\nmoisture. (See 10 Internal Moisture.)\ng.\nAll screws should be fitted with a profiled or bonded washer. Fixing screws shall be aluminium or Grade\n304 stainless steel. Stainless steel screws must be fitted centrally through pre-drilled oversized holes\n(9 mm) for roofing and walls, regardless of sheet length.\nh.\nFor sheet lengths over 3 m, the provision to allow for thermal expansion must be in accordance with the\ntables in 7.3 Thermal Expansion And Contraction.\n 14 \n 14.19 FIXING ALUMINIUM SHEETING\n 14 \n 14.19 \n406\nThis is a controlled document.

It is prudent if he records any damage to the sheets (or lack thereof) at this point, particularly if\nsubsequent trades accessing the roof. Damage of any sort caused by other trades is not the responsibility of the\nroofer.\nAll gutters, valleys, roof channels and the roof cladding should be left clean and free from debris on completion of\nthe work, and any roofing related debris on site should be safely removed.\n 14 \n 14.20 COMPLETION\n 20 \n 14 \n 14.20 \n407\nThis is a controlled document.

If the\nremaining area of a roof or wall section to be covered is less than a standard sheet width, the sheet should be cut\nlengthwise to fit the gap.\nSimilarly, when replacing a roof without removing existing flashings, for example, apron or chimney flashings\nbehind cladding, the area of the retained flashing should be reduced by cutting back to the minimum practically\nachievable.\nIf a roof sheet lap requires extra protection, for instance, when over the apex of a barrel curved roof where pitch is\nless than the minimum stipulated for the product, laps should be sealed rather than double-lapped. Lap tape is\npreferred over gunned sealant for this purpose, as it is less likely to become displaced while positioning the\nsheet.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BDL01 Double Lapping Roofing Sheets\nExtract:\n\"...The side laps of roofing sheets are designed to allow enough drying and air access to prevent wet\nstorage damage.

It is not\nnecessary to face laps away from prevailing wind direction as roofs must be designed to withstand weather from\nany quarter. On critical jobs or when using curved sheets, it is advisable that side laps face away from the line of\nsight.\nSheets should be laid square to the nearest architectural feature, and regularly checked to correct any\nmisalignment of sheet or squareness of structure. Laying out of square will result in saw-toothing of the eaves\nline.

If this is unacceptable, roofs should be designed to Unrestricted Access criteria and roof access and\nusage by other trades should be strongly managed and supervised.\n A small ding in a sheet will not normally cause any structural problems and may be aesthetically acceptable;\nhowever, deeper dings can cause cracking of the sheet and lead to leaks.\nTo restore a damaged rib load capability to the original levels, all damage must be repaired with a cap flashing.\nFor aesthetic reasons, any damage may be unacceptable. However, if the roof cladding is not visible, ribs can be\nrepaired by using a sealed and riveted saddle cap.\n14.18.1A Sealed and Riveted Saddle\nSeal and rivet\nThis ding must also be repaired\nIt is technically acceptable to have two dings or creases on one sheet within one purlin spacing, providing two\nadjacent ribs are not damaged. Any greater level of damage requires the sheets to be replaced, and the person\nwho causes the damage must report it and be responsible for its repair.\n14.18.2 \nWater Ponding \n 14 INSTALLATION\n 14 \n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n400\nThis is a controlled document.

Ponding will detract from a\ncoated steel product's life and will invalidate the product warranty.\nThe installation of penetrations must be done in such a way that they do not cause ponding. See External\nMoisture: Penetrations.\nOn low pitched roofs, careless or excessive foot traffic may cause rib damage and localised ponding. This can be\nminimised by installing temporary protection in critical areas, such as entry points, where the roof is accessed by\nother trades, or there is a step-down in the roof. It is the main contractor's responsibility to ensure that other\ntrades do not damage the roof.\nIt is recommended to design to Unrestricted Access-criteria or better if roofs are highly visible or need to be\nregularly accessed by maintenance personnel.\n14.18.3 \nCorrectly Installed Gutters \nGutters must be installed with adequate fall to ensure water is transported to appropriately located downpipes.\nFalls and joints should be constructed so that water does not pond to a depth of more than 5 mm. Regular gutter\ncleaning and maintenance are required to remove leaves and other debris that may restrict water flow to\ndownpipes. Vertical downpipes are parallel to the wall and adjacent vertical references, such as window jambs.\nA gutter protection system (or any other product) that entraps debris or water between itself and any steel\nproduct surfaces, restricting coated steel's ability to dry, is not recommended and is an exclusion in the product\nwarranty.\n14.18.3A Incorrectly Installed Gutter Protection System\n14.18.4 \nSwarf Damage \nSwarf is the term given to the metal debris arising from cutting or piercing operations when using friction saws,\ndrills, or other tools on roofing and cladding products.

These stains are often mistaken for early deterioration of the roofing and cladding itself.\nSee 4.14 Swarf Staining and Cut Edge Corrosion.\n14.18.4.1 \nPreventing Swarf Damage \nCutting\nCut only by shear; power shears or hand snips produce the least amount of debris.\nPower nibblers give a clean cut but generate debris which if left is prone to corrosion.\nDo not use metal friction blades or reciprocating saws which produce fine hot particles which can embed\ndeeply into the coating surface and corrode rapidly.\nIf metal grinding is taking place near the surface of an installed or uninstalled roof, careful masking of nearby\ncoated steel surfaces must be executed.\nClean-up\nSwarf should be swept or hosed from the job progressively and certainly no less than at the end of each day.\nSwarf that has become stuck must be removed carefully, avoiding action which is likely to remove or change the\nappearance of the paint or metal coatings.\nWhen sweeping or hosing into a gutter, clean out the gutter before leaving the job to prevent premature corrosion.\nOn completion of the job, give a final wash or sweep down.\n14.18.4.2 \nSevere or Extensive Swarf Staining \nIf the coating is severely damaged by swarf corrosion, the area should be painted or replaced. The whole visible\narea should be repaired, as air drying paints weather more rapidly and in a different manner to pre-painted roofing\nand cladding products. If swarf particles are painted over, rust bleed-through is likely to occur.\n14.18.4.3 \nSupervising Other Trades \nA common cause of swarf complaints arises because other trades have used grinding equipment in\nthe vicinity of a newly completed roof. Wind carried swarf can contaminate large areas some\ndistance from the cutting site. Main contractors should be aware of the likelihood of such damage,\nand project planning should include scheduling of all cutting or grinding work to be completed\nbefore laying the roof cladding.\n14.18.5 \nColour Matching Paint \n 14 INSTALLATION\n 14 \n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n402\nThis is a controlled document.

The term touch-up paint should never be used. Fasteners and accessories requiring\ncolour matching should be painted before installation.\nAir-dried paints used to disguise marks weather at a rate different from that of pre-painted material, sometimes\ndramatically so, and will often become more apparent than the mark they are intended to disguise. Minor\nscratches are best left alone, and they will not affect the performance of the pre-painted product due to the self-\nhealing qualities of the primer and metallic coating. They become less evident as the coating weathers.\nMinor scratches may be described as scratches that do not extend to the metallic coating, are less than 3 mm in\nwidth, and are not visually noticeable from a distance of 3 m. This characterisation will, however, vary with the\nconcentration of the scratches, and the visibility of the area affected.\nExtensive coating damage to any pre-painted steel product can only be rectified by replacement or repainting of\nthe affected sheets.\n14.18.5A Visual Impact of Mismatched Paint\n14.18.6 \nField Painting \n 14 INSTALLATION\n 14 \n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n403\nThis is a controlled document.

Metallic coated roofs can be painted immediately after installation; however, dirt, grease, and any loose\nmaterials must be cleaned off, so the surface is clean and dry before applying the first coat.\nAn effective method for painting metallic coated roofing is to apply a good quality galvanised iron primer and two\nwater-based acrylic topcoats, following the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPre-painted products can be painted after exposure to weather. Normally, 6-12 months of exposure is required to\nachieve surface modification of the surface to allow the new coating to adhere.\nEdge laps of unpainted metallic coated sheets steel do not require lap priming.\n14.18.7 \nSunscreen \nSunscreen containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide can accelerate the degradation of organic materials including\nauto finishes and pre-painted cladding surfaces. This damage is irreparable, so prevention of its occurrence is the\nonly defence.

Draped sheets, known as spring curving.\n2. Pre-curved sheets, either roll-curved or crimp-curved.\nThe system used depends on the design of the structure and the selected profile. Spring curving can be used on\nwider radii, while pre-curving can generally be done down to a 300mm or 400mm radius.\nCurved flashings are described in 8.5.5 Curved Flashings\n15.1.1 \nSide Laps: Curved Roofs \nThe minimum pitch for curved roofs may differ from that otherwise recommended for the profile.\nFor barrel curved roofs, the lap sealed section over the apex is exempt from minimum pitch requirements,\nprovided that the required minimum pitch is achieved at the eaves. For mono-pitch curved roofs terminating at a\ntransverse apron or head barge, the minimum pitch at the apex is 5 deg for corrugate or 3 deg for other profiles. Where\nthis is less than the normal recommended for the profile, flashing cover must be increased to the next higher\ncategory in accordance with guidelines in 8.4 Flashing Cover.\nThis limitation does not apply to roofs outside of the building envelope, such as curved verandah roofs, provided\nany spill-over is unable to penetrate the structure.\nSelect your profile, then enter either the height or desired radius in the calculator below to determine the length of\nthe seal.\nThe Code of Practice Online provides an interactive tool for these calculations.

Transverse laps should be\nsealed at both edges to prevent the ingress of both rainwater and condensation, in accordance with 14.11.1\nSealing End Laps.\n15.1.3 \nPenetrations: Curved Roofs \nPenetrations should be placed at the apex, or where the pitch is greater than the minimum for the profile.\n15.1.4 \nVentilation: Curved Roofs \nBarrel curved roofs have no ridging to allow water vapour to exit at the ridge, so other means of venting the\nceiling space should be considered. (See 10.10 Ventilation Pathways.)\n15.1.5 \nThermal Expansion: Curved Roofs \nProvision for expansion should be provided in the same manner as required for straight lengths, but the\nconfiguration of curved roofs means that some expansion will be taken up by a springing of the profile further up,\nwhich results in less movement. When the total sheet length is considered for expansion, positive fixing should\nbe used at the crown, and provision for expansion accommodated on the slopes. Sealed and fastened end laps\ndo not act as an expansion joint.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n413\nThis is a controlled document.

Therefore, it needs to be washed and regularly maintained to comply with the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC and the supplier's warranty. Because pre-painted cladding is not intended for use in this\ntype of micro-climate without regular maintenance, the underside of the soffit should be lined in all severe and\nvery severe environments. (see 16 Maintenance )\n15.1.7 \nSpring Curving \nSpring curving, also known as draping or arching of roofs, is a method of providing continuous lengths of roof\ncladding over a curved roof structure without pre-curving the sheets. It is best suited to corrugated profiles, or\nsymmetrical roofing profiles of low rib height and narrow pan width, which can follow a curve without excessive\npanning or distortion. Asymmetrical rib products have greater minimum radii, which are limited by their pan width\nand rib height.\nBecause symmetrical profiles do not have a large rain-water carrying capacity they are limited in maximum radius\nand length. Maximum radius is limited by the need to provide adequate drainage at the top of the curvature and\nminimum radius is limited by the need to avoid distortion without pre-forming.\nContinuity over a minimum of three purlins is required for successful spring curving and therefore any interruption\nsuch as a penetration may affect the ability of the sheet to drape curve.\nPurlins must be accurately positioned with the top faces tangential to the radius of the arch and should be within\na 5 mm tolerance to avoid purlin creasing. Roof traffic should be restricted to avoid damage, particularly in the\nlow pitched region or in highly visible areas, particularly in the low-pitched region or in highly visible areas. Some\npurlin creasing or canning is to be expected with stronger profiles at minimum radii.\nFor convex roofs, the minimum radii should be adhered to because the pans are in compression, whereas with\nconcave roofs the pans are in tension and the panning or distortion of these roofs will be less.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n414\nThis is a controlled document.

When the base chord is on an incline, the maximum radius can be increased.\nThe two top purlins should be spaced to enable the sheeting to follow an arc that minimises purlin marking.\n15.1.7D Top Purlin Positioning for Spring Curved Roofs\nDraped curved roofs or curved ridges should be fixed by fastening each sheet first to one side of the roof and then\npulling it down to be fixed on the other side. Where sheets are end-lapped, alternate sheets should be laid in\nsequence to avoid cumulative errors and be laid from opposite sides of the roof to ensure squareness is\nmaintained.\nBecause extra uplift load will be imposed on the end fasteners of convex spring curved roofs, through the\ntorsional action of the sheets on the fasteners, screws and load spreading washers should be used on the\npenultimate and the last purlins. This torsional uplift must also be considered when designing purlin to rafter\nconnections and other structures below. \n15.1.8 \nPre-Curved Roofs \nLow tensile metals and G 300 coated steel can be formed into a number of simple and compound shapes. \nGenerally, roll curving is applied to corrugated profiles, and crimp curving to trapezoidal profiles.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n416\nThis is a controlled document.

Setting\nout requires first checking that the materials delivered on site are within specified tolerances, and before\ncommencing work the building should be checked for squareness.\nBoth roll curving and crimp curving will produce a curve with the effective cover dictated by the forming process. \nIt is critical that the material is run to the correct width before being presented to the curving tool, or the effective\ncover of the straight portion will not match that of the curve. A variation of only 2mm between the straight and\ncurved portion of a sheet will make it very difficult, or impossible, to install.\nThe curving process can cause dimensional changes, which can lead to misalignment, so the sheets should be\nkept square with the building. Some minor saw-toothing at the gutter end is to be expected when fitting curved\nsheeting. When multiple curves are required that cannot be provided on one sheet, the sheets should be fixed in\nthe order shown below.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n419\nThis is a controlled document.

Pre-curved corrugated roof cladding is used for bull-nosed\nveranda roofs, ridges, or roofs where the radius is less than the minimum required for sprung or draped curved\nroofs.\nThe sheets are passed through offset curving rolls, which progressively form curves in a wide range of radii down\nto 300 mm. There is, however, a straight portion of about 80 mm at each end of the sheet which may need to be\ntrimmed off if a true curve is required.\nCircular barns have been successfully clad with 0.4 mm steel for many years, but 0.55 mm steel or 0.9 mm\naluminium should be used for roll-curved roofs subject to foot traffic. As roll curving is normally done with G300\nsteel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials must be taken into account when setting\npurlin spacings.\nIf the edge of the sheet is too flat or long, and at tight radii, rippled edges may result, and these should be dressed\nout using a dressing tool, or trimmed off before the sheet is installed.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n420\nThis is a controlled document.

The radius can be altered by the\nspacing of the crimps and the angle of the bend by the number of crimps.\nAs crimp Curving is normally done with G300 steel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials\nmust be taken into account when setting purlin spacings.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n421\nThis is a controlled document.

Structure - the effect of mounting the structures and roof traffic for ongoing maintenance; see 3.7.5 Dead\nLoads and 3.7.4 Roof Traffic.\n2. Durability - corrosion may result from issues such as wet contact, capillary action, unwashed areas, material\ncompatibility, and runoff; see 4.10 Other Causes of Corrosion.\n3.

This may be an organic paint coating applied by either the steel manufacturer before the tiles are\nformed, or by the tile manufacturer after the tiles are formed. An alternative (and traditional) coating can be\nprovided by applying crushed stone or ceramic granules (\"chip\") to the base metallic-coated steel, which is\nattached by an adhesive coating; normally, a clear acrylic coat over the chip coating. Post-applied coating also\nprovides cut-edge protection.\nPressed metal roofing tiles are installed by nominated agent fixers, trained and appointed by the manufacturers or\ntheir representatives. They are not normally supplied to other installers.\n15.3.1.1 \nDurability \nThe principles behind requirements for fixings, flashings, corrosion, compatibility, and maintenance as described\nelsewhere in this COP should also apply to the design and installation of pressed metal tiles.\nFasteners must be compatible with the base metal and provide a service life equivalent to the durability of the\npanel. Typically, these are coated hot-dipped galvanised steel nails.\n15.3.1.2 \nStructure \nMetal tiles must be installed to battens selected, spaced, and attached as per the manufacturer's requirements.\nPanels are fastened to the roof structure by fixing horizontally through the front of the panel, and because the\nfixings are in shear, they provide wind uplift resistance suitable for very high wind design loads.\n15.3.1.3 \nMinimum Pitch \nTiles with a minimum upstand of 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 12 deg or more. Tiles with an\nupstand of less than 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 15 deg or more. Typically, these are tiles\nwith a shingle or shake form.\nThe manufacturer may stipulate greater or lesser minimum pitches for specific designs.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n423\nThis is a controlled document.

The pitch of the roof is not the same as the pitch of the tiles. It varies with the height of the batten\nand the height of the upstand.\n15.3.1.4 \nValleys \nValley gutters must be made of the same metal or coating as the roof tiles or a compatible material.\nValleys must have a minimum upstand of 20 mm and a width of 80 mm. For valley sizing, see 5.5.7\nValley Capacity Calculator.\nValley boards are required to support a point load of 1.1 kN, which approximates the weight of a\ntradesperson with a bag of tools.\n15.3.1.5 \nLongrun Tiles \nLongrun tiles are a hybrid roof cladding with the appearance of pressed metal tile. This is achieved by pressing\nsteps into a length of long run profiled steel, so horizontal laps are minimised or eliminated.\nLongrun tiles are not currently manufactured in New Zealand.\n15.3.2 \nInstallation \nPressed metal roofing tiles are only installed by specifically trained and accredited installers. As the battens go\nover the roofing overlay, the installer is responsible for doing the battens, as well as the underlay and the roof\ncladding.\n15.3.2.1 \nRoof Framing \nRoof framing should provide support and fixing for the tile battens that will satisfy the design wind load\nrequirements. Installers should check that the framing has been erected to an accurate and even line before fixing\nthe roof\n15.3.2.2 \nValley Installation \nValleys are installed so water discharges over the fascia and into the eaves gutter. The valleys are held in\nposition by clips specially designed to allow for expansion, or by compatible nails and washers placed alongside\nthe valley or bent over the top lip of the valley.\nUnder no circumstances must the fasteners penetrate the sole of the valley. The top end of the valley should be\nturned up against the hip or ridge battens to the height of the batten. Where two valleys meet over a dormer, they\nare cut, shaped, joined, and sealed so that they form a continuous valley.\nThe tile edge should be bent down to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\nThe gap between tiles on opposing sides of the valley must be a minimum of 70 mm.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n424\nThis is a controlled document.

Battens at different centres may require different values.\n Battens must have square cut ends and must be butt jointed over the centre line of the rafter.\nAdjacent rows of battens must not be joined on the same rafter and must span at least three rafter spacings at\nthe roof edge.\nA batten must be installed immediately behind the fascia as fixing for the eaves tiles.\nBecause an eaves-tile batten is installed directly behind the fascia, the position of the next batten up the rafter will\nbe less than that of the normal tile batten spacing. The position of this batten may vary depending on the pitch of\nthe roof.\nThe batten layout is marked on the rafters by placing nails at the line of the batten fronts. The roofing underlay is\nlaid over this, onto the rafters. The battens are then laid from the lowest part of the roof upwards, using the\nmarker nails to locate the front edge of the batten. Remove the marker nails before laying the tiles.\n15.3.2.5 \nRoof Traffic \nMetal Tiles are classified as a Type B Restricted Access roof cladding. Walking on metal tiles indiscriminately\nmay cause considerable damage.\nPersons authorised to walk on a metal tile roof must walk only in the tile's pan, where the batten supports it, and\nwear flat, soft-soled shoes to prevent damage to the tiles and surface coatings.\nOther trades must be made aware by the contractor or site supervisor of the method for walking on pressed\nmetal tiles without causing damage, and that the cost of repairing damaged tiles is their responsibility.\n15.3.2.6 \nFlashings \n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n426\nThis is a controlled document.

They come in two styles, only one of which is used\non any one roof. All flashings and roofing accessories are made of the same base metal as the tiles and are\ncoated the same way.\nLong accessories are typically 2 m long and fixed every 500 mm and there are specific accessories for ridges,\nhips, barges, aprons and walls.\nShort accessories are typically 400 mm long trims and can be used for most flashing applications on a roof.\nSpecial flashings are made as required by the manufacturer or the roofer from uncoated steel, and subsequently\nfactory coated using the same coating process as used for tiles.\n15.3.2.6.1 \nRidge \nTiles must be turned up to a minimum of 40 mm against the battens, hip board, or where they butt\nagainst a vertical or an inclined surface.\nThe ridge trim cap or side flashings must cover the tile turn-ups by a minimum of 35 mm.\nRidge tiles are bent up and then cut to form a turn-up that fits under the ridge/hip cap or short accessory. To\nensure a watertight joint, a tight fit is required between the tile and the ridge cap.\n15.3.2.6.1A Ridge and Hip: Short Trim Installation\nRidge/hip caps\nTile\nTile turn-up\nUnderlay\nRafter\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n427\nThis is a controlled document.

If more than one pallet of tiles is required for one job, the colour uniformity should be checked.\nTiles damaged during installation must be removed and replaced, and any deformed tiles or tiles with surface\ndamage must be rejected.\nThe eave gutter tiles should project over the edge of the fascia to ensure that water discharges directly into the\ngutter system, and tiles should be laid so they prevent any water from penetrating the roof cavity.\nBefore tiles are laid, the direction of lay should be determined, taking into account whether the profile can be laid\nonly one way or both ways.\nDirection of lay may be influenced by a desire to face laps away from major lines of sight, direction of prevailing\nweather, or sequencing of construction.\n15.3.5 \nWorkmanship \nStandard lead pencils contain graphite and must not be used on AZ-coated steel tiles, as graphite can cause\npremature corrosion failure of the coating. \nTile cuts and bends must leave straight lines up the roof section to provide a true line for flashings.\nWhen cutting tiles for their installation at ridges, hips, valleys and barges, avoid damage to the surface finish by\nusing a guillotine or metal shears. When cutting the tile lengthwise, it must be bent before cutting to reduce the\namount of distortion that occurs as the profile is flattened during bending.\nTiles turned up and down for ridges, hips, barges, eaves, and valleys must be bent using a bender specifically\ndesigned for this purpose. Tiles must be turned up at ridges, hips and barges by a minimum of 40 mm, and down\ninto the valleys to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n432\nThis is a controlled document.

With the former,\nsheets clip together, the latter has its side ribs clipped to the adjacent sheet.\nTray roofing designed to be fully supported by sarking is referred to in the COP as standing seam roofing. Clauses\nin this section headed Tray Roofing will apply to both types, clauses headed Standing Seam Roofing, including\nLoad/Span tables, will only apply to generic standing seam roofing profiles\nThe profiles and fixing methods for tray roofing date back to traditional methods used to hand-fabricate metal\nroofs, predominantly in Europe and often from non-ferrous metal, prior to the development of roll forming\ntechnology. A by-product of this heritage is that, in addition to the secret clips fastening the main roof, flashings\nshould also be installed on clips with minimal use of exposed rivets and fasteners.\nIn Europe, the installation of tray roofing is done by Spenglers, who serve a 4-year apprenticeship. We do not have\nthe same qualification in NZ, but installers of tray roofing must have specific training and experience in the\nproduct if they are to achieve the expected high standard of workmanship\n15.4.1 \nTray Roofing Materials \nTraditionally standing seam roofs were manufactured from sheets of copper or pure zinc (sometimes even lead)\nand these materials are still popular being naturally durable and weathering to a natural patina. They are also very\nmalleable which allows more variation in intersections and terminations, and they can be soldered.\nMore common in the New Zealand market are pre-painted steel and aluminium substrates. To increase its\nformability, Steel is normally supplied in Medium Strength G300 grade and Aluminium in hardness grade H34.\nSee 4.16 Materials for a more thorough discussion of roofing material.\n15.4.2 \nTray Roofing Profiles \nSelf-support tray roofing profiles resemble a single tray trough section but the ribs are generally narrower and the\ninstallation techniques are more sophisticated. Standing seam profiles generally have rib heights of 25 mm - 45\nmm. Pan widths for both types vary from 300 mm to 500 mm.\n15.4.2A Typical Self-Supporting Profile\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n433\nThis is a controlled document.

The angle seam is the most\npopular and the double seam is the least popular. The roll cap replicates old roofs with a capped joint installed\nover a longitudinal batten.\nOne of the features of standing seam roofs is that they can be formed by folding rather than roll-forming. This\nmakes it possible to install roofs to buildings that are round or sinusoidal in plan, to have \"random\" pan widths, or\nto vary rib width discretely so that ribs are spaced equidistant from associated architectural features such as\npenetrations and windows.\nAll tray roofing, including standing seam profiles, must have clearance between adjacent pans to allow for timber\nshrinkage and transverse thermal expansion of the pan. The non-existence of this clearance gap can cause\nexcessive canning or quilting.\n15.4.2B Angle Seam\n15.4.2C Double Seam\nClearance\n15.4.2D Standing Seam Roll Cap\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n434\nThis is a controlled document.

Installers\nare generally specialist and highly trained and may modify or improvise a detail to suit the needs of a situation.\nBecause of this, the demarcation between design and Installation is not clear cut.\nThe following information on design and installation is generally applicable to all tray roofing including self-\nsupport, apart from the sections on sarking and load tables. Sections particular to standing seam are headed as\nsuch, but there is a large amount of cross-over in many areas.\n15.4.2E Standing Seam Cladding on a\nSinusoidal Building Plan\nSource: Scope 54, p. 31; NZMRM\n15.4.2F Standing Seam Cladding on a\nRound Building.\n Source: UK Guide to Good Practice in Fully Supported\nMetal Roofing and Cladding 3rd Edition; Federation of\nTraditional Metal Roofing Contractors\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n435\nThis is a controlled document.

Generally, options that work with a trapezoidal profile will equally work\nfor tray roofing but are most likely to be installed on secret grab fasteners rather than being riveted. The\nelimination of primary and secondary fasteners is another attribute abetting weathertightness, as are the tight\nlaps and the water carrying capacity of the wide pan.\nThe wide pan of tray roofing makes it impractical to have longitudinal flashings cover two pans, and because of\nthe vertical rib and fastening techniques, longitudinal flashings covering a single pan are acceptable.\n15.4.5 \nTray Fixings \nPerhaps the most outstanding feature of all tray roofs is the minimisation of visible fasteners. Apart from the\nsecret fixing clips, attachment of flashings to the roof should be achieved by crimping to the cladding or other\nflashings or to a grab flashing wherever possible.\nClips for standing seam roofing are normally single clips, fastened to the substrate with screws or annular\ngrooved nails. The sole of the clips should have a rebated or countersunk hole for the fastener, and rounded\nedges, to ensure thermal movement of the sheet does not cause damage by rubbing against sharp edges.\nWall cladding laid horizontally may need additional support and the standard bracket to resist gravity loads.\n15.4.6 \nStanding Seam End Laps \nAs the style of roofing replicates hand-formed products of yesteryear, and because the sheets themselves are\nrelatively flexible, end laps are more common in tray roofs, and more acceptable, than with other profiles. In\npractice, staggered end laps are often used with tray roofing as an architectural design feature.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n436\nThis is a controlled document.

This puts\nmore responsibility on the designer to consider ventilation of the ceiling space. Ventilation is particularly\nimportant for fully supported profiles; the ply must have a gap at the apex to allow for egress of air and a gap at\nthe bottom, or soffit vents, to allow air ingress. \n15.4.8A Standing Seam Ventilation\nBlocking, spaced to suit \nridge capping\nFelt/shingle or membrane\n25 mm Min air gap\nBlocking (nog)\n10 mm gap for ventilation airflow\nPlywood overhang ventilation to suit \ntimber fascia and gutter or metal \ngutter system.

It can be minimised by\nspecifying a narrower pan width and closing clip centres. Further noise reduction can be gained by putting a\nconcave shape into the pan, which can be achieved by:\ninstalling longitudinal stringers (e.g., a 10 mm batten) under the centre of the tray\ninstalling strips of compressive material along the purlins.\nGeotextile mat layers have the most significant effect on noise attenuation, but the added cost of such should be\nweighed against the expected benefits\n15.4.10 \nPenetrations on Tray Roofing \nThe wide flat pan of tray roofing makes it easy to achieve secure penetration details. Proprietary rubber boot\nflashings can be used for small pipe penetrations, but a more aesthetically pleasing solution is to make up a\nflanged upstand in pre-painted steel or colour matched malleable metal, and fit a \"Chinese hat\" to the penetration\nto allow for thermal movement and weatherproofing.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n439\nThis is a controlled document.

Some people accept it as an innate feature\nof a tray product, others want a flat tray with no visible waviness. It may not be obvious, but it is always present in\ntray roofing to some extent. The visibility of canning is affected as much by the lighting, line of sight, cleanliness,\nand gloss levels of the roof, as it is by the degree of canning present in the product.\nClients expecting no canning should be informed of the reality, particularly if the roof runs at an acute angle to\none's line of sight. Canning can also be induced by stretching the material or excessive foot traffic. The substrate\nmust be true to plane and not convex.\nThe most effective ways to minimise canning in a highly visible situation is to use a profile with a narrower pan\nand use material with a low-gloss or textured surface.\nWith self-support tray roofs, excessive foot traffic will accentuate purlin lines, because of the ductility of the\nmetal (grade G300) and the wide flat pan. \n15.4.13 \nInstalling Tray Cladding \nTray roofing is a predominantly flat, secret fixed profile with one tray per sheet and vertical ribs. The roofing\nsheets are clip-fastened, using hidden clips. Tray cladding which is installed on sarking by traditional methods\nwith hand-formed side lap seams is known as standing seam cladding.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n443\nThis is a controlled document.

Prior to commencing the lay, the roofer must determine what the predominant features are on a given\nface and set the roof out to maximise the symmetry of side flashings and matching rib lines. With fully supported\nprofiles, sheets can be folded to varying widths to achieve symmetry across a number of architectural features.\n15.4.13.2 \nCommence Laying Tray Cladding \n1. Install the eaves grab flashing to which the sheets will be crimped and any other flashings that may be behind\nthe cladding, for example, window jamb flashings.\n2. Fit the netting and/or underlay. On flat roofs requiring underlay support, using twine is preferable to netting as\nthe joins in the latter may imprint through the medium strength iron through foot traffic.\n3. Form stop-ends in the sheets.\n4. Then the sheets can be laid, starting from a distance from the barge to give equal cover distance to the\nopposing barge and other architectural features and penetrations. Fasteners should be annular grooved nails\nor screws, with clips at centres specified by the manufacturer to suit the product and wind zone.\nPre-painted tray roofing will usually be supplied with strippable film to give temporary protection from scratching.\nThe film should be removed from underlaps while laying, and removed entirely before UV sets the adhesive\nmaking it difficult to remove without leaving glue residue on the sheet. Traffic across sheets should be kept to a\nminimum, particularly with self-supporting products.\n15.4.13.3 \nProvision for Expansion - Tray Roofing \nNon-ferrous tray roofing expands at about twice the rate of ferrous metals. Supported angle seam and double\nseam profiles must be installed using a balance of sliding clips to allow for expansion, and fixed clips to\nwithstand gravity loads.\nThe position of the fixed clips depends on the roof pitch. The width of the fixed clip portion should be sufficient\nto install five clips at the required spacing.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n444\nThis is a controlled document.

It can be divided into three main\ncategories:\ninsulated panels,\ncomposite or site assembled systems, and\nroofs with insulation sprayed on after installation.\n15.5.1 \nInsulated Panels \nInsulated or sandwich panels are factory-made laminated products using different core materials permanently\nbonded by adhesive or foam to metal skins to act as a single structural element.\n15.5.1.1 \nInsulated Panel Manufacturing \nThe manufacturing process for bonded panels consists of roll forming the flat or profiled sheeting,\nfollowed by the adhesion of the insulation core to both surfaces or skins.\nThere are three methods to do this:\nContinuous production by injecting foaming insulation between 2 metal skins as they are being\nroll-formed.\nContinuous production by glueing pre-formed panels of insulation to roll-formed metal skins.\nIndividual panel production by glueing insulated panels to roll-formed sheets\nBonded composite panels develop their strength from the sandwich of skins and insulation, and are\nmade with a tongue and groove side lap detail that incorporates concealed fasteners.\n15.5.1.2 \nInsulated Panel Composition \nThe structure and composition of an insulated panel are chiefly determined by its end use.\n15.5.1.3 \nInsulated Panel Face Profiles \n Three types of profiles are used on insulated panels. This is largely determined by the spanning requirements and\nease of maintenance.\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n447\nThis is a controlled document.

Panning can be minimised by using a matt finish or\nforming minor ribs or swages on the flat face of the panel.\n15.5.1.4 \nInsulated Panel Face Materials \nThe facings or skins of composite panels are typically metallic coated, pre-painted steel or\naluminium, and are either profiled or flat on either or both sides of the panel. The internal skin is\nalso known as the liner skin or sheeting.\nThe metal facing is commonly made from grade G300 steel of 0.40 - 0.63 BMT thickness, with a pre-\npainted organic finish over a metallic coating. Cool room panels have a galvanised Z275 metallic\ncoating, while interior/exterior structural insulated panels have an aluminium/zinc coating of\nAZ150 or AZ200. Paint coatings are specifically developed to assist in bonding the insulation to the\npanel\nAluminium facings are used in very humid conditions or severe marine environments and can be\nsupplied plain or pre-painted.\n15.5.1.5 \nInsulated Panel Core Materials \n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n448\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common are EPS (Expanded Polystyrene), PPS (Phenolic/Polystyrene), PIR\n(Polyisocyanurate), and mineral fibre.\nEPS\nEPS foam is mainly used for applications where high fire resistance is not a requirement.\nPPS\nPPS may be used where greater fire resistance is required.\nPIR\nPIR foam is increasingly specified because of its fire-resistant properties and better insulation\nefficiency.\nMineral Fibre\nMineral-fibre insulation may be selected for applications where fire resistance and/or acoustic\ninsulation properties are of prime importance.\n15.5.1.6 \nInsulation Panel Insulation Values \nThe insulation thickness of a profiled roof panel varies from 30 mm to 300 mm. To achieve the same insulating\nvalue as a flat panel, a profiled roof panel needs to be thicker. The through fasteners or fixing clips are thermal\nbridges, but it has been shown that these are unlikely to decrease the R-value by more than 2%.\nDifferent cores will also have different values for thermal insulation and noise attenuation, as will the details of\npanel joints and interfaces with other materials.\nThe manufacturer must calculate and state the net insulation value of a panel.\n R-values are the reciprocal of U-values. We will stick with R-value because that is the most commonly used value\nfor roofs and walls.\n15.5.1.7 \nInsulation Panel Structure \nInsulated panels are integral units in which the insulation layer together with the two metal skins act as a beam to\nresist wind and point loads. The bonded insulation core material contributes to the panel's strength by effectively\nincreasing the web depth of the profile and resisting buckling; the depth of the core largely determines the panel's\nresistance to deflection. Panel stiffness is also affected by skin thickness and profile shape.\nInsulated panels are excellent at supporting normal foot traffic without damage because the foam core provides\ncontinuous support to the external sheeting. The number and strength of the fasteners under wind suction loads\ncan limit the maximum purlin spacing.\n15.5.1.8 \nNatural Lighting for Insulated Panels \n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n449\nThis is a controlled document.

Polycarbonate or G.R.P. barrel vault roof lighting may be\nused for greater spans or proprietary systems may be supplied by the manufacturer.\n15.5.1.9 \nInsulated Panel Acoustics \nInsulated panels do not have inherently good acoustic insulation properties. Sound can be lessened by using\nsealed joints, but where higher levels of acoustic attenuation or absorption are required, it may be necessary to\ninstall additional acoustic lining systems.\n15.5.1.10 \nInsulated Panels and Internal Moisture \nMetal facings are effectively impervious to penetration by vapour, and panel cores have a closed\ncell structure which does not permit significant transmission or absorption of vapour. However, to\nprevent the possibility of interstitial condensation, it is necessary to fasten and seal all laps and\ngaps, side-lap joints, transverse laps, and joints and ridges that are exposed to the internal\nenvironment.\nWhen insulated panels are used as cold store insulation, a complete and continuous vapour barrier\nis essential to prevent inward moisture vapour pressure. Any discontinuity will result in a build-up\nof ice which can destroy the panel.\nThe bottom skins of composite panels have an integral side lap with a re-entrant sealing space\nwhich acts as a vapour control, but in high-risk applications such as food processing buildings,\ntextile mills, and indoor swimming pools an additional sealer strip is required in the side lap joint.\n15.5.1.11 \nInsulated Panels Fitness for Purpose \nThermal bowing can occur when the two skins are at significantly different temperatures such as north-facing\nwalls, e.g., when a cool room roof panel is in direct sunshine. The effect is accentuated when the external surface\nis a dark colour and is more severe for aluminium facings.\n15.5.1.12 \nInsulated Panel Installation \nThe use of insulated panels for roof and wall cladding requires the same or similar detailing for Structure,\nDurability, External Moisture, and other design considerations as those for single-skin roof and wall cladding.\n15.5.1.13 \nInsulated Panel Installation Safety \nIn most applications insulated panels can be installed by workers operating off the already installed sheet,\nnegating the need for safely mesh. Many panels are installed using underslung safety nets. Other than that, all\nsafety precautions should be followed as for any other cladding material.\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n450\nThis is a controlled document.

Insulated\npanels are supported on purlins or girts, which should be accurately erected to a maximum tolerance of 3 mm and\na deflection limit of l/600.\n15.5.1.15 \nInsulated Panel Penetrations \nInsulated panels can accommodate penetration openings of 350 mm diameter or 300 mm square without the\nneed for additional structural supports or trimmers. Where larger holes are required, trimmers should be in place\nbefore the erection of the panels.\n15.5.1.16 \nFixing Insulated Panels \nPurpose-designed high thread-type fasteners are required to spread upwards loads and maintain the weather seal\nbetween the metal skin and the washer. Through fixings for roof panels may be rib fixed or located on a mini-rib\nwithin the trough, and should be set snugly to achieve a weatherproof seal without distorting the rib profile. Care\nmust be taken not to over-drive the fasteners as this can cause damage to the G300 outer skin of the panel which\ncan result in water ingress issues\nInsulated roof panels with trapezoidal ribs are through-fixed with a load spreading washer on the rib and require\nlap fixing and sealing at the side laps to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n15.5.1.17 \nInsulated Panel End Laps \nThe maximum practical length of panels for transport and handling efficiency is restricted to approximately 25 m.\nWhere a transverse joint is required, there are two options:\nButt End Lap\nWaterfall Junction\nButt End Lap\nThe lining and insulation are butt-jointed over the purlin, and a 150 mm overlap of the top sheet is formed in the\nexternal weather skin only, using three or more lines of sealant and fasteners. The sealant should be butyl tape,\nsilicone or MS sealant, or self-adhesive closed cell tape according to the specifications of the manufacturer and\nshould be positioned at the top and bottom of the lap. To provide a secure seal with flat or wide pan profiles,\nadditional sealed rivets or stitching screws are required through the top skins only.\nThe challenge with this detail is that there are four layers of material to consider at the side/end junction. While\nsuccessful in many instances, problems developing later are very difficult to remedy.\nWaterfall Junction\nA waterfall step can be achieved by putting a step in the rafter or by increasing purlin cleat heights,\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n451\nThis is a controlled document.

The second challenge is that any gap between the upper and\nlower sheets must be adequately insulated to ensure that the thermal efficiency of the system is not\ncompromised.\n15.5.1.18 \nInsulated Panel Flashings \nFlashings detailing is similar to that used with single-skin roof and wall cladding. The main exception is that\ninternal joints should be designed and sealed so that water vapour cannot impregnate the system.\nThe panels at the ridge and other edges of the roof should be sealed and the lining closed with a metal trim\nmounted on the ridge purlins as detailed by the manufacturer. Any gap between the ends of the composite panels\nshould be insulated to eliminate cold spots or cold bridging. They can be sealed using in-situ injected foam or\nmineral fibre. In high-humidity applications, the liner trim should be sealed to the panels. At end-laps or gaps,\nfoam should be injected to provide a vapour-tight seal.\nWhere required by the manufacturer, eaves panels should have the ends turned down to prevent capillary action\non the underside of the sheet. A metal flashing may also be installed to cover the exposed end of the insulation\nand metal liner when panel ends are visually exposed.\n15.5.1.18A Insulated Panels Ridge Detail\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel ridge flashing\nProfiled filler \nsealed top \nand bottom\n25 mm\nEmbossed\nwasher\nRidge \nnotched \ninto profile\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel closure \nflashing\nPurlin\n5 mm\nGap\nRoof panel\nTurn up panel end\nFill Gaps with\nfoam filler\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n452\nThis is a controlled document.

They are not a true warm\nroof, as the ribs are typically not in contact with the insulation, but they have many of the same attributes as\nwarm roofs.\nThe mechanics of a composite system's performance are complex. Consideration must be given at the design\nstage to ensure the system is suitable for a particular end use. This would include consideration of various\naspects, including practicality of installation, durability of components, thermal performance, and control of\ninternal and interstitial moisture.\nThe advantages of composite systems are that they offer longer runs without the need for roof laps or waterfall\njunctions, and when the time comes for the replacement of the outer weather-proofing roof sheet, the system\nallows for it to be done without disturbance to the operations within the building.\nAcoustic boards can be laid within the system to increase sound absorption either from within the building or\nfrom outside. Installation of the under-liner sheets can make a building largely watertight, allowing other trades to\ncontinue below while the roof is completed.\n15.5.2.1 \nComposite Systems Composistion \nThere are three main types.\nBespoke systems that incorporate layers of material and insulation above the purlin.\nProprietary systems that are built up by layer above the purlin, such systems can be sandwich-type or post and\nrail.\nOverlay systems that are used for re-roofs over existing roofing.\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n455\nThis is a controlled document.

They may be designed as closed systems, or ventilation may be\nintroduced between the insulation and the top surface. The insulation material may be expanded foam, mineral\nwool, or fibreglass blanket. Top surfaces may be profiled metal or membrane.\nPost and rail systems allow thicker insulation to be used, increasing thermal and fire performance.\n15.5.2.2 \nComposite System Installation \nComposite systems are normally laid layer by layer to form the desired system. Typically, they comprise a metal\nbase layer to provide support for the insulation, which is overlaid by a vapour check layer, insulation, underlay, and\nthe top roofing sheet.\nPost and rail systems are often used for overlaying existing roofs in good, safe condition. Another form of\noverlay uses custom-cut blocks as pan infills, over which is laid a continuous insulating layer. These forms of\nroof repair avoid the need for removal and replacement of an existing roof, allowing the building tenants'\noperations to continue uninterrupted.\nWhen installing composite systems, it is important that the vapour control layer is correctly installed and sealed\nto the manufacturer's requirements, and insulation is laid correctly without gaps. Bulk insulation must be able to\nloft up to its design thickness to achieve the design R-value.\nThese systems have a heavy reliance on accurate installation for them to meet their design expectations.\n15.5.2.2A Typical Composite Roof Unvented\nTop Deck\nSynthetic underlay\nPIR board\nLiner deck\nVapour layer\nAcoustic \nboard\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n456\nThis is a controlled document.

It has a greater insulation value per millimetre than other insulation materials, so is particularly suitable\nfor flat roofs and skillion roofs where there is limited air space.\nSpray foam is non-absorbent (less than 1%) and has strong contact with all adjacent building elements. This\nmakes it an effective vapour check, so internal moisture issues must be considered when using this or any other\nnon-permeable system.\n15.5.3.1 \nVentilation of Spray-on Systems \nWhen sprayed foam is applied directly to the underside of profiled metal sheet roofing on a lined building, the\nceiling space must be adequately ventilated by other means.

Check the building to confirm that the wrap is not loose or floppy, is properly attached to the studs, and\nis not sagging between purlins.\n2. Spray a \"flash-coat\" of Polyurethane Spray Foam over the building wrap or cladding contacting the timber\nor metal framing. Allow to set - it will take 5-10 minutes depending on the ambient conditions. The \"Flash-\ncoat\" will tension the building wrap, give it some rigidity, and assist with the curing and adhesion of\nsubsequent layers.\n3. Spray the first pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam onto the flash-coat. Do not exceed 25-30 mm with this\npass. This will render the building wrap/foam composite rigid and able to take the balance of the foam\nwith no distortion.\n4.

        "content": "15.1 \nCurved Roofs \nThere are two primary methods for cladding curved roofs.\n1. Draped sheets, known as spring curving.\n2. Pre-curved sheets, either roll-curved or crimp-curved.\nThe system used depends on the design of the structure and the selected profile. Spring curving can be used on\nwider radii, while pre-curving can generally be done down to a 300mm or 400mm radius.\nCurved flashings are described in 8.5.5 Curved Flashings\n15.1.1 \nSide Laps: Curved Roofs \nThe minimum pitch for curved roofs may differ from that otherwise recommended for the profile.\nFor barrel curved roofs, the lap sealed section over the apex is exempt from minimum pitch requirements,\nprovided that the required minimum pitch is achieved at the eaves. For mono-pitch curved roofs terminating at a\ntransverse apron or head barge, the minimum pitch at the apex is 5 deg for corrugate or 3 deg for other profiles. Where\nthis is less than the normal recommended for the profile, flashing cover must be increased to the next higher\ncategory in accordance with guidelines in 8.4 Flashing Cover.\nThis limitation does not apply to roofs outside of the building envelope, such as curved verandah roofs, provided\nany spill-over is unable to penetrate the structure.\nSelect your profile, then enter either the height or desired radius in the calculator below to determine the length of\nthe seal.\nThe Code of Practice Online provides an interactive tool for these calculations.

Transverse laps should be\nsealed at both edges to prevent the ingress of both rainwater and condensation, in accordance with 14.11.1\nSealing End Laps.\n15.1.3 \nPenetrations: Curved Roofs \nPenetrations should be placed at the apex, or where the pitch is greater than the minimum for the profile.\n15.1.4 \nVentilation: Curved Roofs \nBarrel curved roofs have no ridging to allow water vapour to exit at the ridge, so other means of venting the\nceiling space should be considered. (See 10.10 Ventilation Pathways.)\n15.1.5 \nThermal Expansion: Curved Roofs \nProvision for expansion should be provided in the same manner as required for straight lengths, but the\nconfiguration of curved roofs means that some expansion will be taken up by a springing of the profile further up,\nwhich results in less movement. When the total sheet length is considered for expansion, positive fixing should\nbe used at the crown, and provision for expansion accommodated on the slopes. Sealed and fastened end laps\ndo not act as an expansion joint.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n413\nThis is a controlled document.

Therefore, it needs to be washed and regularly maintained to comply with the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC and the supplier's warranty. Because pre-painted cladding is not intended for use in this\ntype of micro-climate without regular maintenance, the underside of the soffit should be lined in all severe and\nvery severe environments. (see 16 Maintenance )\n15.1.7 \nSpring Curving \nSpring curving, also known as draping or arching of roofs, is a method of providing continuous lengths of roof\ncladding over a curved roof structure without pre-curving the sheets. It is best suited to corrugated profiles, or\nsymmetrical roofing profiles of low rib height and narrow pan width, which can follow a curve without excessive\npanning or distortion. Asymmetrical rib products have greater minimum radii, which are limited by their pan width\nand rib height.\nBecause symmetrical profiles do not have a large rain-water carrying capacity they are limited in maximum radius\nand length. Maximum radius is limited by the need to provide adequate drainage at the top of the curvature and\nminimum radius is limited by the need to avoid distortion without pre-forming.\nContinuity over a minimum of three purlins is required for successful spring curving and therefore any interruption\nsuch as a penetration may affect the ability of the sheet to drape curve.\nPurlins must be accurately positioned with the top faces tangential to the radius of the arch and should be within\na 5 mm tolerance to avoid purlin creasing. Roof traffic should be restricted to avoid damage, particularly in the\nlow pitched region or in highly visible areas, particularly in the low-pitched region or in highly visible areas. Some\npurlin creasing or canning is to be expected with stronger profiles at minimum radii.\nFor convex roofs, the minimum radii should be adhered to because the pans are in compression, whereas with\nconcave roofs the pans are in tension and the panning or distortion of these roofs will be less.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n414\nThis is a controlled document.

When the base chord is on an incline, the maximum radius can be increased.\nThe two top purlins should be spaced to enable the sheeting to follow an arc that minimises purlin marking.\n15.1.7D Top Purlin Positioning for Spring Curved Roofs\nDraped curved roofs or curved ridges should be fixed by fastening each sheet first to one side of the roof and then\npulling it down to be fixed on the other side. Where sheets are end-lapped, alternate sheets should be laid in\nsequence to avoid cumulative errors and be laid from opposite sides of the roof to ensure squareness is\nmaintained.\nBecause extra uplift load will be imposed on the end fasteners of convex spring curved roofs, through the\ntorsional action of the sheets on the fasteners, screws and load spreading washers should be used on the\npenultimate and the last purlins. This torsional uplift must also be considered when designing purlin to rafter\nconnections and other structures below. \n15.1.8 \nPre-Curved Roofs \nLow tensile metals and G 300 coated steel can be formed into a number of simple and compound shapes. \nGenerally, roll curving is applied to corrugated profiles, and crimp curving to trapezoidal profiles.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n416\nThis is a controlled document.

Setting\nout requires first checking that the materials delivered on site are within specified tolerances, and before\ncommencing work the building should be checked for squareness.\nBoth roll curving and crimp curving will produce a curve with the effective cover dictated by the forming process. \nIt is critical that the material is run to the correct width before being presented to the curving tool, or the effective\ncover of the straight portion will not match that of the curve. A variation of only 2mm between the straight and\ncurved portion of a sheet will make it very difficult, or impossible, to install.\nThe curving process can cause dimensional changes, which can lead to misalignment, so the sheets should be\nkept square with the building. Some minor saw-toothing at the gutter end is to be expected when fitting curved\nsheeting. When multiple curves are required that cannot be provided on one sheet, the sheets should be fixed in\nthe order shown below.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n419\nThis is a controlled document.

Pre-curved corrugated roof cladding is used for bull-nosed\nveranda roofs, ridges, or roofs where the radius is less than the minimum required for sprung or draped curved\nroofs.\nThe sheets are passed through offset curving rolls, which progressively form curves in a wide range of radii down\nto 300 mm. There is, however, a straight portion of about 80 mm at each end of the sheet which may need to be\ntrimmed off if a true curve is required.\nCircular barns have been successfully clad with 0.4 mm steel for many years, but 0.55 mm steel or 0.9 mm\naluminium should be used for roll-curved roofs subject to foot traffic. As roll curving is normally done with G300\nsteel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials must be taken into account when setting\npurlin spacings.\nIf the edge of the sheet is too flat or long, and at tight radii, rippled edges may result, and these should be dressed\nout using a dressing tool, or trimmed off before the sheet is installed.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n420\nThis is a controlled document.

The radius can be altered by the\nspacing of the crimps and the angle of the bend by the number of crimps.\nAs crimp Curving is normally done with G300 steel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials\nmust be taken into account when setting purlin spacings.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n421\nThis is a controlled document.

        "content": "15.3 \nPressed Metal Tiles \n15.3.1 \nDesign \nMetal tiles are press-formed to provide a variety of shapes resembling clay tiles, wooden shingles, or shakes.\nThey are interlocked or overlapped laterally and longitudinally and are clipped or fastened to timber or steel\nbattens.\nMetal tiles, shingles, and shakes are normally manufactured from metallic-coated steel, although other metals\ncan also be used.\nPressed steel tiles invariably have an additional protective and decorative coating applied over the metallic-\ncoated steel. This may be an organic paint coating applied by either the steel manufacturer before the tiles are\nformed, or by the tile manufacturer after the tiles are formed. An alternative (and traditional) coating can be\nprovided by applying crushed stone or ceramic granules (\"chip\") to the base metallic-coated steel, which is\nattached by an adhesive coating; normally, a clear acrylic coat over the chip coating. Post-applied coating also\nprovides cut-edge protection.\nPressed metal roofing tiles are installed by nominated agent fixers, trained and appointed by the manufacturers or\ntheir representatives. They are not normally supplied to other installers.\n15.3.1.1 \nDurability \nThe principles behind requirements for fixings, flashings, corrosion, compatibility, and maintenance as described\nelsewhere in this COP should also apply to the design and installation of pressed metal tiles.\nFasteners must be compatible with the base metal and provide a service life equivalent to the durability of the\npanel. Typically, these are coated hot-dipped galvanised steel nails.\n15.3.1.2 \nStructure \nMetal tiles must be installed to battens selected, spaced, and attached as per the manufacturer's requirements.\nPanels are fastened to the roof structure by fixing horizontally through the front of the panel, and because the\nfixings are in shear, they provide wind uplift resistance suitable for very high wind design loads.\n15.3.1.3 \nMinimum Pitch \nTiles with a minimum upstand of 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 12 deg or more. Tiles with an\nupstand of less than 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 15 deg or more. Typically, these are tiles\nwith a shingle or shake form.\nThe manufacturer may stipulate greater or lesser minimum pitches for specific designs.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n423\nThis is a controlled document.

The pitch of the roof is not the same as the pitch of the tiles. It varies with the height of the batten\nand the height of the upstand.\n15.3.1.4 \nValleys \nValley gutters must be made of the same metal or coating as the roof tiles or a compatible material.\nValleys must have a minimum upstand of 20 mm and a width of 80 mm. For valley sizing, see 5.5.7\nValley Capacity Calculator.\nValley boards are required to support a point load of 1.1 kN, which approximates the weight of a\ntradesperson with a bag of tools.\n15.3.1.5 \nLongrun Tiles \nLongrun tiles are a hybrid roof cladding with the appearance of pressed metal tile. This is achieved by pressing\nsteps into a length of long run profiled steel, so horizontal laps are minimised or eliminated.\nLongrun tiles are not currently manufactured in New Zealand.\n15.3.2 \nInstallation \nPressed metal roofing tiles are only installed by specifically trained and accredited installers. As the battens go\nover the roofing overlay, the installer is responsible for doing the battens, as well as the underlay and the roof\ncladding.\n15.3.2.1 \nRoof Framing \nRoof framing should provide support and fixing for the tile battens that will satisfy the design wind load\nrequirements. Installers should check that the framing has been erected to an accurate and even line before fixing\nthe roof\n15.3.2.2 \nValley Installation \nValleys are installed so water discharges over the fascia and into the eaves gutter. The valleys are held in\nposition by clips specially designed to allow for expansion, or by compatible nails and washers placed alongside\nthe valley or bent over the top lip of the valley.\nUnder no circumstances must the fasteners penetrate the sole of the valley. The top end of the valley should be\nturned up against the hip or ridge battens to the height of the batten. Where two valleys meet over a dormer, they\nare cut, shaped, joined, and sealed so that they form a continuous valley.\nThe tile edge should be bent down to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\nThe gap between tiles on opposing sides of the valley must be a minimum of 70 mm.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n424\nThis is a controlled document.

The exception is at the eaves, where it is laid over the eaves batten\nand the fascia. Horizontal underlay laps should have a minimum overlap of 75 mm.\n15.3.2.3A Metal Tile Underlay\nGalvanised nail \nwith neoprene \nwasher\nUnderlay\n15.3.2.4 \nTiling Battens \nTiling battens must be:\nH1.1 boric-treated when used in attic roof construction;\nH1.2 treated when used in skillion roof construction.\nBatten sizes are:\na minimum of 50 mm x 40 mm for 900 mm rafter spacing; and\na minimum of 50 mm x 50 mm for 1200 mm spacing.\nBattens in contact with tiles must not be treated with copper-based preservatives.

Battens at different centres may require different values.\n Battens must have square cut ends and must be butt jointed over the centre line of the rafter.\nAdjacent rows of battens must not be joined on the same rafter and must span at least three rafter spacings at\nthe roof edge.\nA batten must be installed immediately behind the fascia as fixing for the eaves tiles.\nBecause an eaves-tile batten is installed directly behind the fascia, the position of the next batten up the rafter will\nbe less than that of the normal tile batten spacing. The position of this batten may vary depending on the pitch of\nthe roof.\nThe batten layout is marked on the rafters by placing nails at the line of the batten fronts. The roofing underlay is\nlaid over this, onto the rafters. The battens are then laid from the lowest part of the roof upwards, using the\nmarker nails to locate the front edge of the batten. Remove the marker nails before laying the tiles.\n15.3.2.5 \nRoof Traffic \nMetal Tiles are classified as a Type B Restricted Access roof cladding. Walking on metal tiles indiscriminately\nmay cause considerable damage.\nPersons authorised to walk on a metal tile roof must walk only in the tile's pan, where the batten supports it, and\nwear flat, soft-soled shoes to prevent damage to the tiles and surface coatings.\nOther trades must be made aware by the contractor or site supervisor of the method for walking on pressed\nmetal tiles without causing damage, and that the cost of repairing damaged tiles is their responsibility.\n15.3.2.6 \nFlashings \n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n426\nThis is a controlled document.

They come in two styles, only one of which is used\non any one roof. All flashings and roofing accessories are made of the same base metal as the tiles and are\ncoated the same way.\nLong accessories are typically 2 m long and fixed every 500 mm and there are specific accessories for ridges,\nhips, barges, aprons and walls.\nShort accessories are typically 400 mm long trims and can be used for most flashing applications on a roof.\nSpecial flashings are made as required by the manufacturer or the roofer from uncoated steel, and subsequently\nfactory coated using the same coating process as used for tiles.\n15.3.2.6.1 \nRidge \nTiles must be turned up to a minimum of 40 mm against the battens, hip board, or where they butt\nagainst a vertical or an inclined surface.\nThe ridge trim cap or side flashings must cover the tile turn-ups by a minimum of 35 mm.\nRidge tiles are bent up and then cut to form a turn-up that fits under the ridge/hip cap or short accessory.

If more than one pallet of tiles is required for one job, the colour uniformity should be checked.\nTiles damaged during installation must be removed and replaced, and any deformed tiles or tiles with surface\ndamage must be rejected.\nThe eave gutter tiles should project over the edge of the fascia to ensure that water discharges directly into the\ngutter system, and tiles should be laid so they prevent any water from penetrating the roof cavity.\nBefore tiles are laid, the direction of lay should be determined, taking into account whether the profile can be laid\nonly one way or both ways.\nDirection of lay may be influenced by a desire to face laps away from major lines of sight, direction of prevailing\nweather, or sequencing of construction.\n15.3.5 \nWorkmanship \nStandard lead pencils contain graphite and must not be used on AZ-coated steel tiles, as graphite can cause\npremature corrosion failure of the coating. \nTile cuts and bends must leave straight lines up the roof section to provide a true line for flashings.\nWhen cutting tiles for their installation at ridges, hips, valleys and barges, avoid damage to the surface finish by\nusing a guillotine or metal shears. When cutting the tile lengthwise, it must be bent before cutting to reduce the\namount of distortion that occurs as the profile is flattened during bending.\nTiles turned up and down for ridges, hips, barges, eaves, and valleys must be bent using a bender specifically\ndesigned for this purpose. Tiles must be turned up at ridges, hips and barges by a minimum of 40 mm, and down\ninto the valleys to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n432\nThis is a controlled document.

For valley sizing, see 5.5.7\nValley Capacity Calculator.\nValley boards are required to support a point load of 1.1 kN, which approximates the weight of a\ntradesperson with a bag of tools.\n15.3.1.5 \nLongrun Tiles \nLongrun tiles are a hybrid roof cladding with the appearance of pressed metal tile. This is achieved by pressing\nsteps into a length of long run profiled steel, so horizontal laps are minimised or eliminated.\nLongrun tiles are not currently manufactured in New Zealand.\n15.3.2 \nInstallation \nPressed metal roofing tiles are only installed by specifically trained and accredited installers. As the battens go\nover the roofing overlay, the installer is responsible for doing the battens, as well as the underlay and the roof\ncladding.\n15.3.2.1 \nRoof Framing \nRoof framing should provide support and fixing for the tile battens that will satisfy the design wind load\nrequirements. Installers should check that the framing has been erected to an accurate and even line before fixing\nthe roof\n15.3.2.2 \nValley Installation \nValleys are installed so water discharges over the fascia and into the eaves gutter.

        "content": "15.4 \nTray Roofing \nStanding Seam or Tray roofing is similar to trough section in that it is secret fixed, but it consists of just a single\npan per sheet, compared to the two or three pans of a trough section.\nTray roofing may be designed to be self-supporting on purlins, or installed on solid sarking. With the former,\nsheets clip together, the latter has its side ribs clipped to the adjacent sheet.\nTray roofing designed to be fully supported by sarking is referred to in the COP as standing seam roofing. Clauses\nin this section headed Tray Roofing will apply to both types, clauses headed Standing Seam Roofing, including\nLoad/Span tables, will only apply to generic standing seam roofing profiles\nThe profiles and fixing methods for tray roofing date back to traditional methods used to hand-fabricate metal\nroofs, predominantly in Europe and often from non-ferrous metal, prior to the development of roll forming\ntechnology. A by-product of this heritage is that, in addition to the secret clips fastening the main roof, flashings\nshould also be installed on clips with minimal use of exposed rivets and fasteners.\nIn Europe, the installation of tray roofing is done by Spenglers, who serve a 4-year apprenticeship. We do not have\nthe same qualification in NZ, but installers of tray roofing must have specific training and experience in the\nproduct if they are to achieve the expected high standard of workmanship\n15.4.1 \nTray Roofing Materials \nTraditionally standing seam roofs were manufactured from sheets of copper or pure zinc (sometimes even lead)\nand these materials are still popular being naturally durable and weathering to a natural patina. They are also very\nmalleable which allows more variation in intersections and terminations, and they can be soldered.\nMore common in the New Zealand market are pre-painted steel and aluminium substrates. To increase its\nformability, Steel is normally supplied in Medium Strength G300 grade and Aluminium in hardness grade H34.\nSee 4.16 Materials for a more thorough discussion of roofing material.\n15.4.2 \nTray Roofing Profiles \nSelf-support tray roofing profiles resemble a single tray trough section but the ribs are generally narrower and the\ninstallation techniques are more sophisticated. Standing seam profiles generally have rib heights of 25 mm - 45\nmm. Pan widths for both types vary from 300 mm to 500 mm.\n15.4.2A Typical Self-Supporting Profile\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n433\nThis is a controlled document.

The angle seam is the most\npopular and the double seam is the least popular. The roll cap replicates old roofs with a capped joint installed\nover a longitudinal batten.\nOne of the features of standing seam roofs is that they can be formed by folding rather than roll-forming. This\nmakes it possible to install roofs to buildings that are round or sinusoidal in plan, to have \"random\" pan widths, or\nto vary rib width discretely so that ribs are spaced equidistant from associated architectural features such as\npenetrations and windows.\nAll tray roofing, including standing seam profiles, must have clearance between adjacent pans to allow for timber\nshrinkage and transverse thermal expansion of the pan. The non-existence of this clearance gap can cause\nexcessive canning or quilting.\n15.4.2B Angle Seam\n15.4.2C Double Seam\nClearance\n15.4.2D Standing Seam Roll Cap\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n434\nThis is a controlled document.

Installers\nare generally specialist and highly trained and may modify or improvise a detail to suit the needs of a situation.\nBecause of this, the demarcation between design and Installation is not clear cut.\nThe following information on design and installation is generally applicable to all tray roofing including self-\nsupport, apart from the sections on sarking and load tables. Sections particular to standing seam are headed as\nsuch, but there is a large amount of cross-over in many areas.\n15.4.2E Standing Seam Cladding on a\nSinusoidal Building Plan\nSource: Scope 54, p. 31; NZMRM\n15.4.2F Standing Seam Cladding on a\nRound Building.\n Source: UK Guide to Good Practice in Fully Supported\nMetal Roofing and Cladding 3rd Edition; Federation of\nTraditional Metal Roofing Contractors\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n435\nThis is a controlled document.

Generally, options that work with a trapezoidal profile will equally work\nfor tray roofing but are most likely to be installed on secret grab fasteners rather than being riveted. The\nelimination of primary and secondary fasteners is another attribute abetting weathertightness, as are the tight\nlaps and the water carrying capacity of the wide pan.\nThe wide pan of tray roofing makes it impractical to have longitudinal flashings cover two pans, and because of\nthe vertical rib and fastening techniques, longitudinal flashings covering a single pan are acceptable.\n15.4.5 \nTray Fixings \nPerhaps the most outstanding feature of all tray roofs is the minimisation of visible fasteners. Apart from the\nsecret fixing clips, attachment of flashings to the roof should be achieved by crimping to the cladding or other\nflashings or to a grab flashing wherever possible.\nClips for standing seam roofing are normally single clips, fastened to the substrate with screws or annular\ngrooved nails. The sole of the clips should have a rebated or countersunk hole for the fastener, and rounded\nedges, to ensure thermal movement of the sheet does not cause damage by rubbing against sharp edges.\nWall cladding laid horizontally may need additional support and the standard bracket to resist gravity loads.\n15.4.6 \nStanding Seam End Laps \nAs the style of roofing replicates hand-formed products of yesteryear, and because the sheets themselves are\nrelatively flexible, end laps are more common in tray roofs, and more acceptable, than with other profiles. In\npractice, staggered end laps are often used with tray roofing as an architectural design feature.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n436\nThis is a controlled document.

This puts\nmore responsibility on the designer to consider ventilation of the ceiling space. Ventilation is particularly\nimportant for fully supported profiles; the ply must have a gap at the apex to allow for egress of air and a gap at\nthe bottom, or soffit vents, to allow air ingress. \n15.4.8A Standing Seam Ventilation\nBlocking, spaced to suit \nridge capping\nFelt/shingle or membrane\n25 mm Min air gap\nBlocking (nog)\n10 mm gap for ventilation airflow\nPlywood overhang ventilation to suit \ntimber fascia and gutter or metal \ngutter system.

It can be minimised by\nspecifying a narrower pan width and closing clip centres. Further noise reduction can be gained by putting a\nconcave shape into the pan, which can be achieved by:\ninstalling longitudinal stringers (e.g., a 10 mm batten) under the centre of the tray\ninstalling strips of compressive material along the purlins.\nGeotextile mat layers have the most significant effect on noise attenuation, but the added cost of such should be\nweighed against the expected benefits\n15.4.10 \nPenetrations on Tray Roofing \nThe wide flat pan of tray roofing makes it easy to achieve secure penetration details. Proprietary rubber boot\nflashings can be used for small pipe penetrations, but a more aesthetically pleasing solution is to make up a\nflanged upstand in pre-painted steel or colour matched malleable metal, and fit a \"Chinese hat\" to the penetration\nto allow for thermal movement and weatherproofing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n439\nThis is a controlled document.

Some people accept it as an innate feature\nof a tray product, others want a flat tray with no visible waviness. It may not be obvious, but it is always present in\ntray roofing to some extent. The visibility of canning is affected as much by the lighting, line of sight, cleanliness,\nand gloss levels of the roof, as it is by the degree of canning present in the product.\nClients expecting no canning should be informed of the reality, particularly if the roof runs at an acute angle to\none's line of sight. Canning can also be induced by stretching the material or excessive foot traffic. The substrate\nmust be true to plane and not convex.\nThe most effective ways to minimise canning in a highly visible situation is to use a profile with a narrower pan\nand use material with a low-gloss or textured surface.\nWith self-support tray roofs, excessive foot traffic will accentuate purlin lines, because of the ductility of the\nmetal (grade G300) and the wide flat pan. \n15.4.13 \nInstalling Tray Cladding \nTray roofing is a predominantly flat, secret fixed profile with one tray per sheet and vertical ribs. The roofing\nsheets are clip-fastened, using hidden clips. Tray cladding which is installed on sarking by traditional methods\nwith hand-formed side lap seams is known as standing seam cladding.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n443\nThis is a controlled document.

Prior to commencing the lay, the roofer must determine what the predominant features are on a given\nface and set the roof out to maximise the symmetry of side flashings and matching rib lines. With fully supported\nprofiles, sheets can be folded to varying widths to achieve symmetry across a number of architectural features.\n15.4.13.2 \nCommence Laying Tray Cladding \n1. Install the eaves grab flashing to which the sheets will be crimped and any other flashings that may be behind\nthe cladding, for example, window jamb flashings.\n2. Fit the netting and/or underlay. On flat roofs requiring underlay support, using twine is preferable to netting as\nthe joins in the latter may imprint through the medium strength iron through foot traffic.\n3. Form stop-ends in the sheets.\n4. Then the sheets can be laid, starting from a distance from the barge to give equal cover distance to the\nopposing barge and other architectural features and penetrations. Fasteners should be annular grooved nails\nor screws, with clips at centres specified by the manufacturer to suit the product and wind zone.\nPre-painted tray roofing will usually be supplied with strippable film to give temporary protection from scratching.\nThe film should be removed from underlaps while laying, and removed entirely before UV sets the adhesive\nmaking it difficult to remove without leaving glue residue on the sheet. Traffic across sheets should be kept to a\nminimum, particularly with self-supporting products.\n15.4.13.3 \nProvision for Expansion - Tray Roofing \nNon-ferrous tray roofing expands at about twice the rate of ferrous metals. Supported angle seam and double\nseam profiles must be installed using a balance of sliding clips to allow for expansion, and fixed clips to\nwithstand gravity loads.\nThe position of the fixed clips depends on the roof pitch. The width of the fixed clip portion should be sufficient\nto install five clips at the required spacing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n444\nThis is a controlled document.

Some people accept it as an innate feature\nof a tray product, others want a flat tray with no visible waviness. It may not be obvious, but it is always present in\ntray roofing to some extent. The visibility of canning is affected as much by the lighting, line of sight, cleanliness,\nand gloss levels of the roof, as it is by the degree of canning present in the product.\nClients expecting no canning should be informed of the reality, particularly if the roof runs at an acute angle to\none's line of sight. Canning can also be induced by stretching the material or excessive foot traffic. The substrate\nmust be true to plane and not convex.\nThe most effective ways to minimise canning in a highly visible situation is to use a profile with a narrower pan\nand use material with a low-gloss or textured surface.\nWith self-support tray roofs, excessive foot traffic will accentuate purlin lines, because of the ductility of the\nmetal (grade G300) and the wide flat pan. \n15.4.13 \nInstalling Tray Cladding \nTray roofing is a predominantly flat, secret fixed profile with one tray per sheet and vertical ribs. The roofing\nsheets are clip-fastened, using hidden clips. Tray cladding which is installed on sarking by traditional methods\nwith hand-formed side lap seams is known as standing seam cladding.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n443\nThis is a controlled document.

        "content": "15.5 \nWarm Roofs \nWarm roofs are where insulation is in direct contact with the roof cladding. It can be divided into three main\ncategories:\ninsulated panels,\ncomposite or site assembled systems, and\nroofs with insulation sprayed on after installation.\n15.5.1 \nInsulated Panels \nInsulated or sandwich panels are factory-made laminated products using different core materials permanently\nbonded by adhesive or foam to metal skins to act as a single structural element.\n15.5.1.1 \nInsulated Panel Manufacturing \nThe manufacturing process for bonded panels consists of roll forming the flat or profiled sheeting,\nfollowed by the adhesion of the insulation core to both surfaces or skins.\nThere are three methods to do this:\nContinuous production by injecting foaming insulation between 2 metal skins as they are being\nroll-formed.\nContinuous production by glueing pre-formed panels of insulation to roll-formed metal skins.\nIndividual panel production by glueing insulated panels to roll-formed sheets\nBonded composite panels develop their strength from the sandwich of skins and insulation, and are\nmade with a tongue and groove side lap detail that incorporates concealed fasteners.\n15.5.1.2 \nInsulated Panel Composition \nThe structure and composition of an insulated panel are chiefly determined by its end use.\n15.5.1.3 \nInsulated Panel Face Profiles \n Three types of profiles are used on insulated panels. This is largely determined by the spanning requirements and\nease of maintenance.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n447\nThis is a controlled document.

Panning can be minimised by using a matt finish or\nforming minor ribs or swages on the flat face of the panel.\n15.5.1.4 \nInsulated Panel Face Materials \nThe facings or skins of composite panels are typically metallic coated, pre-painted steel or\naluminium, and are either profiled or flat on either or both sides of the panel. The internal skin is\nalso known as the liner skin or sheeting.\nThe metal facing is commonly made from grade G300 steel of 0.40 - 0.63 BMT thickness, with a pre-\npainted organic finish over a metallic coating. Cool room panels have a galvanised Z275 metallic\ncoating, while interior/exterior structural insulated panels have an aluminium/zinc coating of\nAZ150 or AZ200. Paint coatings are specifically developed to assist in bonding the insulation to the\npanel\nAluminium facings are used in very humid conditions or severe marine environments and can be\nsupplied plain or pre-painted.\n15.5.1.5 \nInsulated Panel Core Materials \n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n448\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common are EPS (Expanded Polystyrene), PPS (Phenolic/Polystyrene), PIR\n(Polyisocyanurate), and mineral fibre.\nEPS\nEPS foam is mainly used for applications where high fire resistance is not a requirement.\nPPS\nPPS may be used where greater fire resistance is required.\nPIR\nPIR foam is increasingly specified because of its fire-resistant properties and better insulation\nefficiency.\nMineral Fibre\nMineral-fibre insulation may be selected for applications where fire resistance and/or acoustic\ninsulation properties are of prime importance.\n15.5.1.6 \nInsulation Panel Insulation Values \nThe insulation thickness of a profiled roof panel varies from 30 mm to 300 mm. To achieve the same insulating\nvalue as a flat panel, a profiled roof panel needs to be thicker. The through fasteners or fixing clips are thermal\nbridges, but it has been shown that these are unlikely to decrease the R-value by more than 2%.\nDifferent cores will also have different values for thermal insulation and noise attenuation, as will the details of\npanel joints and interfaces with other materials.\nThe manufacturer must calculate and state the net insulation value of a panel.\n R-values are the reciprocal of U-values. We will stick with R-value because that is the most commonly used value\nfor roofs and walls.\n15.5.1.7 \nInsulation Panel Structure \nInsulated panels are integral units in which the insulation layer together with the two metal skins act as a beam to\nresist wind and point loads. The bonded insulation core material contributes to the panel's strength by effectively\nincreasing the web depth of the profile and resisting buckling; the depth of the core largely determines the panel's\nresistance to deflection. Panel stiffness is also affected by skin thickness and profile shape.\nInsulated panels are excellent at supporting normal foot traffic without damage because the foam core provides\ncontinuous support to the external sheeting. The number and strength of the fasteners under wind suction loads\ncan limit the maximum purlin spacing.\n15.5.1.8 \nNatural Lighting for Insulated Panels \n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n449\nThis is a controlled document.

Polycarbonate or G.R.P. barrel vault roof lighting may be\nused for greater spans or proprietary systems may be supplied by the manufacturer.\n15.5.1.9 \nInsulated Panel Acoustics \nInsulated panels do not have inherently good acoustic insulation properties. Sound can be lessened by using\nsealed joints, but where higher levels of acoustic attenuation or absorption are required, it may be necessary to\ninstall additional acoustic lining systems.\n15.5.1.10 \nInsulated Panels and Internal Moisture \nMetal facings are effectively impervious to penetration by vapour, and panel cores have a closed\ncell structure which does not permit significant transmission or absorption of vapour. However, to\nprevent the possibility of interstitial condensation, it is necessary to fasten and seal all laps and\ngaps, side-lap joints, transverse laps, and joints and ridges that are exposed to the internal\nenvironment.\nWhen insulated panels are used as cold store insulation, a complete and continuous vapour barrier\nis essential to prevent inward moisture vapour pressure. Any discontinuity will result in a build-up\nof ice which can destroy the panel.\nThe bottom skins of composite panels have an integral side lap with a re-entrant sealing space\nwhich acts as a vapour control, but in high-risk applications such as food processing buildings,\ntextile mills, and indoor swimming pools an additional sealer strip is required in the side lap joint.\n15.5.1.11 \nInsulated Panels Fitness for Purpose \nThermal bowing can occur when the two skins are at significantly different temperatures such as north-facing\nwalls, e.g., when a cool room roof panel is in direct sunshine. The effect is accentuated when the external surface\nis a dark colour and is more severe for aluminium facings.\n15.5.1.12 \nInsulated Panel Installation \nThe use of insulated panels for roof and wall cladding requires the same or similar detailing for Structure,\nDurability, External Moisture, and other design considerations as those for single-skin roof and wall cladding.\n15.5.1.13 \nInsulated Panel Installation Safety \nIn most applications insulated panels can be installed by workers operating off the already installed sheet,\nnegating the need for safely mesh. Many panels are installed using underslung safety nets. Other than that, all\nsafety precautions should be followed as for any other cladding material.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n450\nThis is a controlled document.

Insulated\npanels are supported on purlins or girts, which should be accurately erected to a maximum tolerance of 3 mm and\na deflection limit of l/600.\n15.5.1.15 \nInsulated Panel Penetrations \nInsulated panels can accommodate penetration openings of 350 mm diameter or 300 mm square without the\nneed for additional structural supports or trimmers. Where larger holes are required, trimmers should be in place\nbefore the erection of the panels.\n15.5.1.16 \nFixing Insulated Panels \nPurpose-designed high thread-type fasteners are required to spread upwards loads and maintain the weather seal\nbetween the metal skin and the washer. Through fixings for roof panels may be rib fixed or located on a mini-rib\nwithin the trough, and should be set snugly to achieve a weatherproof seal without distorting the rib profile. Care\nmust be taken not to over-drive the fasteners as this can cause damage to the G300 outer skin of the panel which\ncan result in water ingress issues\nInsulated roof panels with trapezoidal ribs are through-fixed with a load spreading washer on the rib and require\nlap fixing and sealing at the side laps to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n15.5.1.17 \nInsulated Panel End Laps \nThe maximum practical length of panels for transport and handling efficiency is restricted to approximately 25 m.\nWhere a transverse joint is required, there are two options:\nButt End Lap\nWaterfall Junction\nButt End Lap\nThe lining and insulation are butt-jointed over the purlin, and a 150 mm overlap of the top sheet is formed in the\nexternal weather skin only, using three or more lines of sealant and fasteners. The sealant should be butyl tape,\nsilicone or MS sealant, or self-adhesive closed cell tape according to the specifications of the manufacturer and\nshould be positioned at the top and bottom of the lap. To provide a secure seal with flat or wide pan profiles,\nadditional sealed rivets or stitching screws are required through the top skins only.\nThe challenge with this detail is that there are four layers of material to consider at the side/end junction. While\nsuccessful in many instances, problems developing later are very difficult to remedy.\nWaterfall Junction\nA waterfall step can be achieved by putting a step in the rafter or by increasing purlin cleat heights,\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n451\nThis is a controlled document.

The second challenge is that any gap between the upper and\nlower sheets must be adequately insulated to ensure that the thermal efficiency of the system is not\ncompromised.\n15.5.1.18 \nInsulated Panel Flashings \nFlashings detailing is similar to that used with single-skin roof and wall cladding. The main exception is that\ninternal joints should be designed and sealed so that water vapour cannot impregnate the system.\nThe panels at the ridge and other edges of the roof should be sealed and the lining closed with a metal trim\nmounted on the ridge purlins as detailed by the manufacturer. Any gap between the ends of the composite panels\nshould be insulated to eliminate cold spots or cold bridging. They can be sealed using in-situ injected foam or\nmineral fibre. In high-humidity applications, the liner trim should be sealed to the panels. At end-laps or gaps,\nfoam should be injected to provide a vapour-tight seal.\nWhere required by the manufacturer, eaves panels should have the ends turned down to prevent capillary action\non the underside of the sheet. A metal flashing may also be installed to cover the exposed end of the insulation\nand metal liner when panel ends are visually exposed.\n15.5.1.18A Insulated Panels Ridge Detail\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel ridge flashing\nProfiled filler \nsealed top \nand bottom\n25 mm\nEmbossed\nwasher\nRidge \nnotched \ninto profile\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel closure \nflashing\nPurlin\n5 mm\nGap\nRoof panel\nTurn up panel end\nFill Gaps with\nfoam filler\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n452\nThis is a controlled document.

They are not a true warm\nroof, as the ribs are typically not in contact with the insulation, but they have many of the same attributes as\nwarm roofs.\nThe mechanics of a composite system's performance are complex. Consideration must be given at the design\nstage to ensure the system is suitable for a particular end use. This would include consideration of various\naspects, including practicality of installation, durability of components, thermal performance, and control of\ninternal and interstitial moisture.\nThe advantages of composite systems are that they offer longer runs without the need for roof laps or waterfall\njunctions, and when the time comes for the replacement of the outer weather-proofing roof sheet, the system\nallows for it to be done without disturbance to the operations within the building.\nAcoustic boards can be laid within the system to increase sound absorption either from within the building or\nfrom outside. Installation of the under-liner sheets can make a building largely watertight, allowing other trades to\ncontinue below while the roof is completed.\n15.5.2.1 \nComposite Systems Composistion \nThere are three main types.\nBespoke systems that incorporate layers of material and insulation above the purlin.\nProprietary systems that are built up by layer above the purlin, such systems can be sandwich-type or post and\nrail.\nOverlay systems that are used for re-roofs over existing roofing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n455\nThis is a controlled document.

They may be designed as closed systems, or ventilation may be\nintroduced between the insulation and the top surface. The insulation material may be expanded foam, mineral\nwool, or fibreglass blanket. Top surfaces may be profiled metal or membrane.\nPost and rail systems allow thicker insulation to be used, increasing thermal and fire performance.\n15.5.2.2 \nComposite System Installation \nComposite systems are normally laid layer by layer to form the desired system. Typically, they comprise a metal\nbase layer to provide support for the insulation, which is overlaid by a vapour check layer, insulation, underlay, and\nthe top roofing sheet.\nPost and rail systems are often used for overlaying existing roofs in good, safe condition. Another form of\noverlay uses custom-cut blocks as pan infills, over which is laid a continuous insulating layer. These forms of\nroof repair avoid the need for removal and replacement of an existing roof, allowing the building tenants'\noperations to continue uninterrupted.\nWhen installing composite systems, it is important that the vapour control layer is correctly installed and sealed\nto the manufacturer's requirements, and insulation is laid correctly without gaps. Bulk insulation must be able to\nloft up to its design thickness to achieve the design R-value.\nThese systems have a heavy reliance on accurate installation for them to meet their design expectations.\n15.5.2.2A Typical Composite Roof Unvented\nTop Deck\nSynthetic underlay\nPIR board\nLiner deck\nVapour layer\nAcoustic \nboard\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n456\nThis is a controlled document.

It can also be applied to walls, ceilings, and under floors. Spray foam may be applied to any roofing\nprofile. It has a greater insulation value per millimetre than other insulation materials, so is particularly suitable\nfor flat roofs and skillion roofs where there is limited air space.\nSpray foam is non-absorbent (less than 1%) and has strong contact with all adjacent building elements. This\nmakes it an effective vapour check, so internal moisture issues must be considered when using this or any other\nnon-permeable system.\n15.5.3.1 \nVentilation of Spray-on Systems \nWhen sprayed foam is applied directly to the underside of profiled metal sheet roofing on a lined building, the\nceiling space must be adequately ventilated by other means. (See 10 Internal Moisture.)\nInstallation with underlay.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n458\nThis is a controlled document.

Check the building to confirm that the wrap is not loose or floppy, is properly attached to the studs, and\nis not sagging between purlins.\n2. Spray a \"flash-coat\" of Polyurethane Spray Foam over the building wrap or cladding contacting the timber\nor metal framing. Allow to set - it will take 5-10 minutes depending on the ambient conditions. The \"Flash-\ncoat\" will tension the building wrap, give it some rigidity, and assist with the curing and adhesion of\nsubsequent layers.\n3. Spray the first pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam onto the flash-coat. Do not exceed 25-30 mm with this\npass. This will render the building wrap/foam composite rigid and able to take the balance of the foam\nwith no distortion.\n4. Spray the second pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam to the desired thickness to achieve the required R-\nvalue (or up to a maximum of 100mm per pass).\n15.5.3.1A Spray-on Foam with Underlay\nRoof cladding\nUnderlay\nTop chord \nor rafter\nSpray-on \nfoam\n15.5.3.1B Spray-on Foam without Underlay\nDPC\nover\npurlin\nRoof \ncladding\nTop chord or rafter\nSpray-on foam\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n459\nThis is a controlled document.

Insulated\npanels are supported on purlins or girts, which should be accurately erected to a maximum tolerance of 3 mm and\na deflection limit of l/600.\n15.5.1.15 \nInsulated Panel Penetrations \nInsulated panels can accommodate penetration openings of 350 mm diameter or 300 mm square without the\nneed for additional structural supports or trimmers. Where larger holes are required, trimmers should be in place\nbefore the erection of the panels.\n15.5.1.16 \nFixing Insulated Panels \nPurpose-designed high thread-type fasteners are required to spread upwards loads and maintain the weather seal\nbetween the metal skin and the washer.

They are not a true warm\nroof, as the ribs are typically not in contact with the insulation, but they have many of the same attributes as\nwarm roofs.\nThe mechanics of a composite system's performance are complex. Consideration must be given at the design\nstage to ensure the system is suitable for a particular end use. This would include consideration of various\naspects, including practicality of installation, durability of components, thermal performance, and control of\ninternal and interstitial moisture.\nThe advantages of composite systems are that they offer longer runs without the need for roof laps or waterfall\njunctions, and when the time comes for the replacement of the outer weather-proofing roof sheet, the system\nallows for it to be done without disturbance to the operations within the building.\nAcoustic boards can be laid within the system to increase sound absorption either from within the building or\nfrom outside. Installation of the under-liner sheets can make a building largely watertight, allowing other trades to\ncontinue below while the roof is completed.\n15.5.2.1 \nComposite Systems Composistion \nThere are three main types.\nBespoke systems that incorporate layers of material and insulation above the purlin.\nProprietary systems that are built up by layer above the purlin, such systems can be sandwich-type or post and\nrail.\nOverlay systems that are used for re-roofs over existing roofing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n455\nThis is a controlled document.

Following the Manufacturer's maintenance requirements.\nb. Washing down surfaces, particularly exterior building elements subject to wind-blown salt spray.\nc. Re-coating exterior and interior protective finishes.\nIn general, NZ metal roofing materials exposed to rain washing can be expected to comply with NZBC B2 without\nmanual washing, or replacement of protective finishes - but unwashed areas, which includes all wall cladding,\nmay require maintenance.\nWhere access for maintenance of unwashed areas is impractical, the use of non-ferrous metal cladding may be\nadvantageous in meeting NZBC requirements.\n 16 \n 16.1 MAINTENANCE COMPLIANCE\n 1 \n 16 \n 16.1 \n461\nThis is a controlled document.

This should occur at all washing intervals or at least annually. Observations\nfrom this inspection can be used to determine frequency requirements of general washing, and whether any high-\nrisk areas, for instance around flues or outlets, sheltered areas of roofing, or areas contaminated by birds, require\nmore frequent attention.\n 16 \n 16.2 INSPECTION\n 2 \n 16 \n 16.2 \n462\nThis is a controlled document.

Minor surface scratches are best\nleft because they become less noticeable as the coating weathers. If the scratch cannot be seen from the ground,\nit should be left alone.\n 16 \n 16.3 REACTIVE MAINTENANCE\n 3 \n 16 \n 16.3 \n463\nThis is a controlled document.

Inspection\nshould always be an included part of scheduled maintenance.\nWashing Cladding\nThe accumulation of deposits on a metal surface may increase the time of wetness of that surface and also\nincrease the corrosivity of the wetness. Most exposed metal roofing will be adequately cleared of dirt by rain\nwashing, but that is not the case with unwashed areas. Unwashed areas include all wall cladding. It is particularly\napplicable to areas directly sheltered from the rain, which includes all surfaces that are above a line drawn at 45 deg \nto an overhang, such as a soffit, underside of a canopy, under spouting, or garage door head.\nManual washing is required to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris or other material not removed by rain on\nthese surfaces, carried out at intervals as prescribed by the manufacturer.\nGenerally, metal wall cladding subject to some direct rain should be washed:\nevery 6 months in severe environments; and\nevery 12 months in moderate environments.\nGenerally, other unwashed areas should be washed:\nevery 3 months for severe environments; and\nevery 6 months for moderate environments.\nWashing can be carried out with water and a sponge, soft brush or broom, or water blaster up to 20 mPa, directed\naway from the overlap of the sheets. Detergent will help remove deposits if it can be applied without increasing\nthe risk of slip and fall.\n 16 \n 16.4 SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE\n 16 \n 16.4 \n464\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n16.5 \nPreventative Maintenance \nPreventative Maintenance is work that provides extra protection in high-risk and vulnerable areas and is intended\nto prevent or minimise later requirements for reactive maintenance. It can be achieved by enhancing the product\nbefore installation, or by maintaining such areas more regularly than the body of the cladding.\nWhere the underside of metal roof cladding is subject to contaminants such as salt at the gutter line, an eaves\nflashing should be inserted under the roof and over the gutter to prevent deposits which lead to 'inside out'\ncorrosion. This flashing can assist where dissimilar metals are used for gutters, or spouting where splashes and\ncontaminants can corrode the roof cladding. (See 8.5.4.4 Eaves Flashing). Where the gutter line micro-\nenvironment is likely to be severe, the exposed underside of metal cladding can be painted using a two-pack\nepoxy primer or elastomeric polyurethane paint before installation.\nThe most efficient protection of the eaves in severe marine areas is to use a high front spouting system where\nthe front face of the spouting meets or exceeds the height of the roofing crests. These can be custom folded if\nnecessary.\nSeagulls perching on ridging, parapets or aerials on buildings can cause damage from rubbish dropped onto the\nroof, and from their alkali droppings. Discouraging devices such as wire or spikes can be used to prevent this.\nUnpainted aluminium or AZ coatings are particularly vulnerable to alkali.\nRoof Cladding exposed to the elements from the underside should be included in the maintenance schedule for\nunwashed areas.\n 16 \n 16.5 PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE\n 5 \n 16 \n 16.5 \n465\nThis is a controlled document.

Such areas may require more frequent maintenance than adjacent\nareas.\nDetails that trap debris against the roof, such as loose cables or gutter leaf guards, can be removed to allow free\ndraining of these areas. Soil or lush vegetation at the base of wall cladding can also be removed to prolong the\nlife of the cladding material.\n 16 \n 16.6 SPECIAL MAINTENANCE\n 6 \n 16 \n 16.6 \n466\nThis is a controlled document.

Graffiti removal is likely to\naffect the pre-painted finishes on metal roof and wall cladding, and before removal is attempted a small area\nshould be cleaned as a trial. Graffiti removers may soften the paint, remove the gloss or cause permanent\ndamage.\nDo not use MEK (methyl ethyl ketone), toluene, acetone or thinners. Overpainting or replacement are the\nalternative options.\nThere are clear anti-graffiti coatings available, but their compatibility with the pre-painted cladding must be\nchecked with their supplier.\n 16 \n 16.7 WASHING\n 7 \n 16 \n 16.7 \n469\nThis is a controlled document.

This clause provides generic recommendations; in all cases, the advice of the\npaint supplier should be studied and followed.\n16.8.1 \nPreparation for Overpainting \n1. Thoroughly clean the surface with fresh flowing water and a medium stiff nylon bristle broom, or water blast at\n20 MPa. When cleaning the profile to remove dirt, lichen, mould, or algae, care should be taken not to drive\nwater under laps or flashings. Detergent or proprietary roof wash may be added (if safe) to aid dirt removal, but\nif used should be flushed off with fresh water before drying.\n2. Rinse the profile thoroughly, as any remaining dirt will impair subsequent paint adhesion. Particular attention\nshould be given to the drip edge (where the final 15 mm is prone to heavy dirt build-up), and to the coating at\nthe front edge of tile profiles, as dirt collects in this area leading to mould, algae, and lichen growth.\n3. Fallout around flues and vents needs to be removed before painting.\n4. Allow the roof to dry.\n16.8.1.1 \nWhite Corrosion \nThorough washing will remove most light deposits, and coating loss may be compensated for with metal-rich\nprimer. Heavy deposits may require the same treatment as rust. \n16.8.1.2 \nRed Corrosion \nManually abrade the red rust down to bright metal, being careful not to overly remove adjacent metallic coatings.\nPrime with a metal-rich primer and overcoat with an anti-corrosive primer and compatible topcoat.\nThe use of rust neutralisers is an alternative but must be used with caution. Many are aggressive to remaining\nmetallic coatings, some retain corrosion salts which may cause undercut corrosion in the future, and some, if not\ncompletely removed after application, will accelerate corrosion. If considering this path, use it strictly according\nto the manufacturer's recommendations and requirements.\n16.8.2 \nPaint Application \nHigh-quality, 100% acrylic paint can give a service life of up to 10 years or more when applied to specification on\ncorrectly prepared metal surfaces. This lifespan will vary with colour, roof orientation and the aesthetic\nrequirements of the situation. Poor paint curing will downgrade durability.\n 16 \n 16.8 OVERPAINTING\n 8 \n 16 \n 16.8 \n470\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nFor many paints, a 50 dry film build is required to achieve optimal thickness, and typically this requires two\nlayers of top-coat.\nPaint should not be applied on wet days when condensation has not completely dried, or when ambient\ntemperatures are expected to reach less than 10 deg or more than 30 deg within the drying period. Windy days are also\nnot recommended, as curing is impaired.\nRidge ladders should be fitted with protective buffers or rubber pads as they can cause abrasion damage to pre-\ncoated metal cladding. Where it is possible the painter should walk in the pan, but when it is necessary to step on\nthe rib, (only at the purlin line) attention should be paid to sheet overlaps as these may spring up after a painter's\nweight is removed and reveal an unpainted line.\nDecking profiles have a tight roll-formed bend at the top of the upstand and care is necessary to ensure the\nspecified film build is applied in this area.\nBrush Application:\nThe use of nylon brushes is advisable, and these should be wetted with water prior to use to avoid clogging, and\nin warm weather should be washed out completely at every rest break, or wrapped in cling film and refrigerated.\nRoller Application:\nRoller application is not preferred for profiled metal roofing as it tends to apply an uneven paint film thickness.\nThe combined use of brush and roller can give good results with tray profiles.\nDampen the roller prior to use, apply with even pressure, and do not over-roll.\nSpray Application:\nSpray application in the hands of a skilled applicator can achieve the most consistent film builds. However,\nairless spray equipment can produce very high film builds giving rise to runs and uneven coatings. When using\nspray equipment on hot or windy days, the paint spray may dry before it has reached the metal, which leaves a\nsandy appearance and feel. This is not aesthetically acceptable and will not provide the even coating or durability\nrequired.\n16.8.3 \nUnpainted Cladding \nThe practice of leaving metal-coated roof cladding to weather before painting is no longer required. With the\nlatest developments in primers, roofs can now be painted immediately after installation.\nFor un-weathered AZ-coated cladding, only acrylic galvanised iron primers should be used, as solvent-borne\nprimers may damage the coating. A solvent-borne corrosion-resistant galvanised-iron primer should, however,\nbe used for optimum performance on weathered AZ or galvanised-coated cladding. Wash and allow to dry (see\npreparation above.\nApply primer.\nApply two coats of acrylic roofing paint in the selected colour to provide the required paint thickness.\n(Typically two brush-applied coats achieve 50 m).\n16.8.4 \n 16 \n 16.8 OVERPAINTING\n 8 \n 16 \n 16.8 \n471\nThis is a controlled document.

Variations in natural light conditions will emphasise these\ndifferences producing unacceptable aesthetic variations. For this reason, the whole roof area should be painted\nand not patch-painted.\nIf the over-painting is carried out while the topcoat is still in sound condition, there is no need to use a primer.\nApply two coats of acrylic roofing paint in the selected colour to provide the paint thickness. (Typically two\nbrush-applied coats achieve 50 m ).\n16.8.5 \nUnweathered Pre-Painted Cladding \nIt is not easy to obtain adhesion to unweathered pre-painted metal cladding. To prepare such surfaces for\npainting, abrade all surfaces with fine grit sandpaper, stiff nylon bristle broom or similar, to improve the adhesion.\nCare should be exercised not to sand through the existing paint surface on external bends.\nIf the purpose of overpainting new cladding is to obtain a colour finish that is not available in pre-painted material,\nit is often more economical to order pre-primed material rather than try to overpaint an un-weathered pre-painted\nsurface.\n 16 \n 16.8 OVERPAINTING\n 8 \n 16 \n 16.8 \n472\nThis is a controlled document.

It can be achieved by enhancing the product\nbefore installation, or by maintaining such areas more regularly than the body of the cladding.\nWhere the underside of metal roof cladding is subject to contaminants such as salt at the gutter line, an eaves\nflashing should be inserted under the roof and over the gutter to prevent deposits which lead to 'inside out'\ncorrosion. This flashing can assist where dissimilar metals are used for gutters, or spouting where splashes and\ncontaminants can corrode the roof cladding. (See 8.5.4.4 Eaves Flashing). Where the gutter line micro-\nenvironment is likely to be severe, the exposed underside of metal cladding can be painted using a two-pack\nepoxy primer or elastomeric polyurethane paint before installation.\nThe most efficient protection of the eaves in severe marine areas is to use a high front spouting system where\nthe front face of the spouting meets or exceeds the height of the roofing crests. These can be custom folded if\nnecessary.\nSeagulls perching on ridging, parapets or aerials on buildings can cause damage from rubbish dropped onto the\nroof, and from their alkali droppings. Discouraging devices such as wire or spikes can be used to prevent this.\nUnpainted aluminium or AZ coatings are particularly vulnerable to alkali.\nRoof Cladding exposed to the elements from the underside should be included in the maintenance schedule for\nunwashed areas.\n 16 MAINTENANCE\n 16 \n 5 \n 16 \n 16.5 \n465\nThis is a controlled document.

This lifespan will vary with colour, roof orientation and the aesthetic\nrequirements of the situation.

This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nFor many paints, a 50 dry film build is required to achieve optimal thickness, and typically this requires two\nlayers of top-coat.\nPaint should not be applied on wet days when condensation has not completely dried, or when ambient\ntemperatures are expected to reach less than 10 deg or more than 30 deg within the drying period. Windy days are also\nnot recommended, as curing is impaired.\nRidge ladders should be fitted with protective buffers or rubber pads as they can cause abrasion damage to pre-\ncoated metal cladding. Where it is possible the painter should walk in the pan, but when it is necessary to step on\nthe rib, (only at the purlin line) attention should be paid to sheet overlaps as these may spring up after a painter's\nweight is removed and reveal an unpainted line.\nDecking profiles have a tight roll-formed bend at the top of the upstand and care is necessary to ensure the\nspecified film build is applied in this area.\nBrush Application:\nThe use of nylon brushes is advisable, and these should be wetted with water prior to use to avoid clogging, and\nin warm weather should be washed out completely at every rest break, or wrapped in cling film and refrigerated.\nRoller Application:\nRoller application is not preferred for profiled metal roofing as it tends to apply an uneven paint film thickness.\nThe combined use of brush and roller can give good results with tray profiles.\nDampen the roller prior to use, apply with even pressure, and do not over-roll.\nSpray Application:\nSpray application in the hands of a skilled applicator can achieve the most consistent film builds. However,\nairless spray equipment can produce very high film builds giving rise to runs and uneven coatings. When using\nspray equipment on hot or windy days, the paint spray may dry before it has reached the metal, which leaves a\nsandy appearance and feel. This is not aesthetically acceptable and will not provide the even coating or durability\nrequired.\n16.8.3 \nUnpainted Cladding \nThe practice of leaving metal-coated roof cladding to weather before painting is no longer required. With the\nlatest developments in primers, roofs can now be painted immediately after installation.\nFor un-weathered AZ-coated cladding, only acrylic galvanised iron primers should be used, as solvent-borne\nprimers may damage the coating. A solvent-borne corrosion-resistant galvanised-iron primer should, however,\nbe used for optimum performance on weathered AZ or galvanised-coated cladding. Wash and allow to dry (see\npreparation above.\nApply primer.\nApply two coats of acrylic roofing paint in the selected colour to provide the required paint thickness.\n(Typically two brush-applied coats achieve 50 m).\n16.8.4 \n 16 MAINTENANCE\n 16 \n 8 \n 16 \n 16.8 \n471\nThis is a controlled document.

Variations in natural light conditions will emphasise these\ndifferences producing unacceptable aesthetic variations. For this reason, the whole roof area should be painted\nand not patch-painted.\nIf the over-painting is carried out while the topcoat is still in sound condition, there is no need to use a primer.\nApply two coats of acrylic roofing paint in the selected colour to provide the paint thickness. (Typically two\nbrush-applied coats achieve 50 m ).\n16.8.5 \nUnweathered Pre-Painted Cladding \nIt is not easy to obtain adhesion to unweathered pre-painted metal cladding. To prepare such surfaces for\npainting, abrade all surfaces with fine grit sandpaper, stiff nylon bristle broom or similar, to improve the adhesion.\nCare should be exercised not to sand through the existing paint surface on external bends.\nIf the purpose of overpainting new cladding is to obtain a colour finish that is not available in pre-painted material,\nit is often more economical to order pre-primed material rather than try to overpaint an un-weathered pre-painted\nsurface.\n 16 MAINTENANCE\n 16 \n 8 \n 16 \n 16.8 \n472\nThis is a controlled document.

This testing is used to demonstrate compliance with NZBC B1 - Structure\nCompliance with NZBC B2 - Durability is demonstrated by testing of profiled metal and fasteners. This testing is\nbased on AS/NZS2728 and AS/NZS 3566 respectively, again with some modifications.\nAlso included, are the MRM soft edge standard, and testing and performance standard for pre-painted coil.\n 17 \n 17 \n473\nThis is a controlled document.

Structural Testing covers uniformly distributed load (UDL) and concentrated (point load).\nThese procedures apply to all metals and plastic sheeting.\nThe UDL test simulates wind uplift by subjecting test specimens to pressure from underneath.\nUDL testing is typically carried out to simulate outward loads, where material is restrained by fasteners (or clips)\nat intermittent points; rather than inward loads where material is retrained linearly by purlins or girts. Even with\nasymmetrical trapezoidal profiles, failure adjacent to the fastener from the imposition of outward loads is\ninevitably cause of failure in typical applications. \nTesting for inward load can also be conducted, if required.\n17.1.1 \nStandards: AS Standards and COP Testing Standard \nThere is no specific New Zealand Standard for testing sheet roof and wall cladding. The MRM standard is broadly\nbased on the Australian Standards AS 1562.1:2018 and the AS 4040 series. These Standards are inter-related; AS\n1562.1 sets out the performance requirements to be achieved using the test methodology of AS 4040.\nThe MRM standard differs from the above standards in some significant aspects.\n17.1.1.1 \nUDL Load Testing Standard \nAS 1562.1 defines serviceability failure as a level of deflection under load.\nIn the COP standard, deflection testing is normative for wall cladding and informative for roof cladding. \nAdditionally, the COP standard defines serviceability failure of pierce fastened roofing as permanent deformation,\nwhen permanent distortion or splitting occurs around the fastener head. The load at which permanent distortion\noccurs around the fastener head is defined as serviceability failure and the roof can still resist greater loads, but\nthe damage would affect weather tightness.\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n474\nThis is a controlled document.

This is to\nassess the profile strength when laypeople or careless roof traffic fail to adhere to manufacturers'\nrecommendations.\n17.1.2 \nTest Requirements \n17.1.2A Uniformly distributed Load (UDL)\n1. Serviceability tests:\na. Deflection under load.\nb. Permanent deformation or cracking around the fastener head, or de-indexing or de-clipping of clip fastened\nprofiles. Serviceability failure of clip-fastened products may occur when a clip disengages from the central\nrib, but the weathertightness of the lap is not affected, and the roof can continue to resist increased loads.\n2. Strength tests.\nStrength tests are defined as: sheet unable to resist further loads, i.e. pull-off from clips, buckling, tearing or\npull-through of fasteners.\n17.1.2B Point Load\n1. Resistance to point load on the pan, or to two ribs of narrow profiles, at the weakest point.\n2. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\n3. Resistance to point load on a single rib at the weakest point.\n4. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\nLoad is applied in a downward direction through a rubber-faced pad. The weakest point is generally mid-span at\nthe rib/pan adjacent to the underlap.\n17.1.2.1 \nSupporting Structure and Equipment \n17.1.2.1A Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)\nThe design of the support system for wind load should consist of a rigid frame airbox, sealed on the bottom and\nfour sides. A fan or blower is required, capable of controlling and maintaining the required test pressure, and\npressure measuring devices. The deflection can be measured using several differential displacement transducers\nand traced and recorded coincidentally with the increasing load. Purlin and end wall positions can be changed to\ntest for multiple spans of different dimensions.\nThe use of airbags rather than air pressure is not endorsed by the MRM COP\n17.1.2.1B Point Load\nFor point load testing, a means of applying and measuring a continuously increasing load is positioned above the\npart of the material being tested. \n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n476\nThis is a controlled document.

Three is\npreferred as it results in a higher confidence factor. At least three different spans must be tested, and four is\npreferred as it gives a more accurate gradient to load-span graphs. For confirmatory testing to review previous\ntest results, smaller sample sizes are acceptable providing results are consistent with previous tests.\n17.1.2.2.2 \nWidth of Specimen \nThe width of a model or the test section of a lapped or interlocking system must be the width represented by at\nleast two sheet side laps. The total width of the testing rig (2.1 m) must be covered by the test sample or other\nmaterial.\n17.1.2.2.3 \nNumber of Spans \nFor testing continuous spans, the test specimen should incorporate no fewer than five spans; i.e., two end and\nthree intermediate spans. End spans should be two-thirds of the span of internal spans. Tests using four spans\n(two end spans and two internal spans) or three equal spans may be validated by comparing results against a\nfive-span test of the same sample and adjusting the resultant load tables accordingly.\n17.1.3 \nTesting Procedure \nDifferent testing regimens should be used for UDL testing or Point Load Testing.\n17.1.3.1 \nUDL Testing \nThe samples are assembled on the testbed in accordance with how they are intended to be used, with the ends\nand sides sealed to minimise loss of air pressure. Measuring devices for deflection are placed at static points\n(fasteners) and pan centre at mid-span or as required to measure maximum deflection.\nThe air pressure is raised incrementally, and the point of deflection failure noted. With pierce-fastened products,\nsigns of imminent deformation are observed. When product nears deformation failure, pressure may be\nperiodically backed off to allow loosening of a fastener to inspect the integrity of cladding profile underneath. The\npressure at these points should be noted. The maximum serviceability load test result is the recorded pressure\nlevel at the last observation before the onset of failure or the point before which the pressure level recorder\nshowed a sudden small drop signifying profile movement.\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n477\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nMore than one serviceability result may be recorded from separate fasteners during a single test if, at the\ndiscretion of the testing engineer, the loads imposed on subsequent failure points are equivalent to those\nimposed on the initial failure point\nIf lap screws are added for the purpose of attaining failure pressures by decreasing air leakage, these must not be\npositioned closer than 0.5 m to the nearest purlin.\nClip fastened sections that de-clip at the central rib or de-index on a lap but still resist increased pressure,\nrepresents a serviceability failure.\nLoad is then increased to establish the strength load result. This may be when pierce-fastened cladding pulls\nfasteners through the profile or clip fastened profile de-clips. Both these actions result in sudden and permanent\nloss of air pressure and terminate the test. The load at which this occurs, or maximum load achievable due to air\nleakage, is recorded.\nIf strength load limits cannot be attained by the testing apparatus, a load of at least 2.0 times the serviceability\nload must be imposed to demonstrate that the sample failure load is governed by serviceability rather than by\nstrength. If serviceability/strength ratios exceed 2.0 for at least two different spans, it may be assumed that the\nratio will be similar on all spans.\nFastener pull-out from testbed purlins is not recorded as a failure as this is independent of the profile strength\nand is relevant only to the condition of the purlin material on the testbed. Such fasteners may be replaced or\nrepositioned and the test recommenced.\n17.1.3.2 \nPoint Load Testing \nConcentrated load must be applied in a direction perpendicular to the roof through a circular steel disc of 100 mm\ndiameter faced with a 20 mm thick rubber pad, with a Shore A Durometer hardness of 30-70, to the part of the\nprofile judged to be least resistant to load. See 3.6.1A Point Load Test at the MRM.\nWhere the dimension of the sheeting profile does not allow the use of a 100 (2) mm diameter pad, the shape\nmust be spread over two ribs by way of a disc and pad of 100 mm width.\nThe pressure cell and deflection sensor are positioned above the profile pan or rib at mid-span. For Type A\n(unrestricted access) and B roofs (restricted access), the load is increased to 1.32 kN, the pressure is released,\nand residual deflection is measured after 1 minute. Residual deflection must be less than S/1000 or 1.5 mm,\nwhichever is higher. The pressure is then increased to failure (or at least 2.41 kN) and noted. For Type C (non-\ntrafficable) and wall cladding, the initial pressure requirement is 0.60 kN and the secondary load is 1.1kN.\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n478\nThis is a controlled document.

Before they can be offered as a design guide they must be\nchecked and interpreted by an engineer and have suitable factors applied to the test result figures. It is highly\ndesirable that this person has witnessed at least some of the tests being conducted. As fastener pull-out is not\nincluded in testing, published load-span tables should encourage the designer to check for pull out values of\nspecified fasteners when fastening into timber or ply less than 30 mm thick, into composite materials, or into\nsteel sections less than 1.2 mm thick.\n17.1.5.1 \nAllowance for Variation \n17.1.5.1A Factors to Allow for Variability of Structural Units\nNo of units tested\nCoefficient of Variation (COV)\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n1\n1.2\n1.46\n1.79\n2.21\n2\n1.17\n1.38\n1.64\n1.96\n3\n1.15\n1.33\n1.65\n1.83\n1.15\n1.3\n1.5\n1.74\n5\n1.13\n1.28\n1.46\n1.67\n10\n1.1\n1.21\n1.34\n1.49\n20\n1.06\n1.13\n1.21\n1.29\n100\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\nCoefficient of Variation (COV) is derived from Standard Dev / Av for a group of tests.

For strength loads, a coefficient of 10% may be assumed unless there is evidence that a higher figure\nis warranted. For clip-fastened products, the applied depreciation factor may not be less than 1.3.\nThe number of units tested relates to the number of valid results derived from a given fastener configuration and\npurlin spacing.\nFor values between those listed in the table, interpolation may be used.\n17.1.5.2 \nInterpreting UDL Load Results \nWhen using data from testing for producing graphs, tables, or other design aids, the following conditions apply:\na.\nData must not be extrapolated except where a minimum of four span-combinations within the limitations\nof (b) below can be shown to provide a statistically reliable load span graph. In such cases, an\nextrapolation of a further 10% at either end may be calculated.\nb.\nInterpolation of data between different spans of a specific type of test is acceptable only in the following\ncircumstances:\n<i>\nWhere the data is taken from tests for a single type, size, and profile of cladding and type and\nspacing of fastener.\n<ii>\nWhere at least three different spans or support spacings have been tested for the same type, size,\nand profile of cladding and fastener details, and that in all three tests the failure mode was the\nsame.\n<iii> Where test loads were derived from the same test criteria.\nc.\nThe client may decide whether to publish deflection results. When published they may elect to:\n<i>\nPublish delfection under load as a measurement \n<ii>\nPublish deflection as pass/fail where pass is less than or equal to (span/120) + P/30, where P is the\nmaximum lateral distance between cladding fasteners.\n<iii> Both of the above.\n17.1.5.3 \nInterpreting Point Load Results \nPoint load requirement for trafficable roofs is defined in NZS 1170 as 1.1 kN, which approximates a 100 kg\nperson on one foot. (Note: many workers carrying tools or equipment exceed this limit.) To allow for statistical\nvariation this is factored by 20% and a test load of 1.32 kN is applied to give a pass/fail.\nType A roof (unrestricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load on the rib without\ndeformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType B roof (restricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load in the pan or over two ribs\nwithout deformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType C Roof (non-trafficable) is required to withstand a 0.6 kN test load to the pan or over two ribs, and a 1.1 kN\nstrength load.

        "content": "17.1 \nMetal Cladding Testing \nThis section sets out the testing methodology to evaluate the structural performance of sheet roof and wall\ncladding systems. Structural Testing covers uniformly distributed load (UDL) and concentrated (point load).\nThese procedures apply to all metals and plastic sheeting.\nThe UDL test simulates wind uplift by subjecting test specimens to pressure from underneath.\nUDL testing is typically carried out to simulate outward loads, where material is restrained by fasteners (or clips)\nat intermittent points; rather than inward loads where material is retrained linearly by purlins or girts. Even with\nasymmetrical trapezoidal profiles, failure adjacent to the fastener from the imposition of outward loads is\ninevitably cause of failure in typical applications. \nTesting for inward load can also be conducted, if required.\n17.1.1 \nStandards: AS Standards and COP Testing Standard \nThere is no specific New Zealand Standard for testing sheet roof and wall cladding. The MRM standard is broadly\nbased on the Australian Standards AS 1562.1:2018 and the AS 4040 series. These Standards are inter-related; AS\n1562.1 sets out the performance requirements to be achieved using the test methodology of AS 4040.\nThe MRM standard differs from the above standards in some significant aspects.\n17.1.1.1 \nUDL Load Testing Standard \nAS 1562.1 defines serviceability failure as a level of deflection under load.\nIn the COP standard, deflection testing is normative for wall cladding and informative for roof cladding. \nAdditionally, the COP standard defines serviceability failure of pierce fastened roofing as permanent deformation,\nwhen permanent distortion or splitting occurs around the fastener head. The load at which permanent distortion\noccurs around the fastener head is defined as serviceability failure and the roof can still resist greater loads, but\nthe damage would affect weather tightness.\n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n474\nThis is a controlled document.

This is to\nassess the profile strength when laypeople or careless roof traffic fail to adhere to manufacturers'\nrecommendations.\n17.1.2 \nTest Requirements \n17.1.2A Uniformly distributed Load (UDL)\n1. Serviceability tests:\na. Deflection under load.\nb. Permanent deformation or cracking around the fastener head, or de-indexing or de-clipping of clip fastened\nprofiles. Serviceability failure of clip-fastened products may occur when a clip disengages from the central\nrib, but the weathertightness of the lap is not affected, and the roof can continue to resist increased loads.\n2. Strength tests.\nStrength tests are defined as: sheet unable to resist further loads, i.e. pull-off from clips, buckling, tearing or\npull-through of fasteners.\n17.1.2B Point Load\n1. Resistance to point load on the pan, or to two ribs of narrow profiles, at the weakest point.\n2. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\n3. Resistance to point load on a single rib at the weakest point.\n4. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\nLoad is applied in a downward direction through a rubber-faced pad. The weakest point is generally mid-span at\nthe rib/pan adjacent to the underlap.\n17.1.2.1 \nSupporting Structure and Equipment \n17.1.2.1A Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)\nThe design of the support system for wind load should consist of a rigid frame airbox, sealed on the bottom and\nfour sides. A fan or blower is required, capable of controlling and maintaining the required test pressure, and\npressure measuring devices. The deflection can be measured using several differential displacement transducers\nand traced and recorded coincidentally with the increasing load. Purlin and end wall positions can be changed to\ntest for multiple spans of different dimensions.\nThe use of airbags rather than air pressure is not endorsed by the MRM COP\n17.1.2.1B Point Load\nFor point load testing, a means of applying and measuring a continuously increasing load is positioned above the\npart of the material being tested. \n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n476\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n17.1.2.2 \nTest Set-up \nFor tests to have value, testers should pay attention to the number of specimens, width of the testing sections,\nand the number of spans.\n17.1.2.2.1 \nNumber of Specimens \nFor new testing, at least two sets of specimens should be provided for each span-fastener combination. Three is\npreferred as it results in a higher confidence factor. At least three different spans must be tested, and four is\npreferred as it gives a more accurate gradient to load-span graphs. For confirmatory testing to review previous\ntest results, smaller sample sizes are acceptable providing results are consistent with previous tests.\n17.1.2.2.2 \nWidth of Specimen \nThe width of a model or the test section of a lapped or interlocking system must be the width represented by at\nleast two sheet side laps. The total width of the testing rig (2.1 m) must be covered by the test sample or other\nmaterial.\n17.1.2.2.3 \nNumber of Spans \nFor testing continuous spans, the test specimen should incorporate no fewer than five spans; i.e., two end and\nthree intermediate spans. End spans should be two-thirds of the span of internal spans. Tests using four spans\n(two end spans and two internal spans) or three equal spans may be validated by comparing results against a\nfive-span test of the same sample and adjusting the resultant load tables accordingly.\n17.1.3 \nTesting Procedure \nDifferent testing regimens should be used for UDL testing or Point Load Testing.\n17.1.3.1 \nUDL Testing \nThe samples are assembled on the testbed in accordance with how they are intended to be used, with the ends\nand sides sealed to minimise loss of air pressure. Measuring devices for deflection are placed at static points\n(fasteners) and pan centre at mid-span or as required to measure maximum deflection.\nThe air pressure is raised incrementally, and the point of deflection failure noted. With pierce-fastened products,\nsigns of imminent deformation are observed. When product nears deformation failure, pressure may be\nperiodically backed off to allow loosening of a fastener to inspect the integrity of cladding profile underneath. The\npressure at these points should be noted. The maximum serviceability load test result is the recorded pressure\nlevel at the last observation before the onset of failure or the point before which the pressure level recorder\nshowed a sudden small drop signifying profile movement.\n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n477\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nMore than one serviceability result may be recorded from separate fasteners during a single test if, at the\ndiscretion of the testing engineer, the loads imposed on subsequent failure points are equivalent to those\nimposed on the initial failure point\nIf lap screws are added for the purpose of attaining failure pressures by decreasing air leakage, these must not be\npositioned closer than 0.5 m to the nearest purlin.\nClip fastened sections that de-clip at the central rib or de-index on a lap but still resist increased pressure,\nrepresents a serviceability failure.\nLoad is then increased to establish the strength load result. This may be when pierce-fastened cladding pulls\nfasteners through the profile or clip fastened profile de-clips. Both these actions result in sudden and permanent\nloss of air pressure and terminate the test. The load at which this occurs, or maximum load achievable due to air\nleakage, is recorded.\nIf strength load limits cannot be attained by the testing apparatus, a load of at least 2.0 times the serviceability\nload must be imposed to demonstrate that the sample failure load is governed by serviceability rather than by\nstrength. If serviceability/strength ratios exceed 2.0 for at least two different spans, it may be assumed that the\nratio will be similar on all spans.\nFastener pull-out from testbed purlins is not recorded as a failure as this is independent of the profile strength\nand is relevant only to the condition of the purlin material on the testbed. Such fasteners may be replaced or\nrepositioned and the test recommenced.\n17.1.3.2 \nPoint Load Testing \nConcentrated load must be applied in a direction perpendicular to the roof through a circular steel disc of 100 mm\ndiameter faced with a 20 mm thick rubber pad, with a Shore A Durometer hardness of 30-70, to the part of the\nprofile judged to be least resistant to load. See 3.6.1A Point Load Test at the MRM.\nWhere the dimension of the sheeting profile does not allow the use of a 100 (2) mm diameter pad, the shape\nmust be spread over two ribs by way of a disc and pad of 100 mm width.\nThe pressure cell and deflection sensor are positioned above the profile pan or rib at mid-span. For Type A\n(unrestricted access) and B roofs (restricted access), the load is increased to 1.32 kN, the pressure is released,\nand residual deflection is measured after 1 minute. Residual deflection must be less than S/1000 or 1.5 mm,\nwhichever is higher. The pressure is then increased to failure (or at least 2.41 kN) and noted. For Type C (non-\ntrafficable) and wall cladding, the initial pressure requirement is 0.60 kN and the secondary load is 1.1kN.\n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n478\nThis is a controlled document.

Before they can be offered as a design guide they must be\nchecked and interpreted by an engineer and have suitable factors applied to the test result figures. It is highly\ndesirable that this person has witnessed at least some of the tests being conducted. As fastener pull-out is not\nincluded in testing, published load-span tables should encourage the designer to check for pull out values of\nspecified fasteners when fastening into timber or ply less than 30 mm thick, into composite materials, or into\nsteel sections less than 1.2 mm thick.\n17.1.5.1 \nAllowance for Variation \n17.1.5.1A Factors to Allow for Variability of Structural Units\nNo of units tested\nCoefficient of Variation (COV)\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n1\n1.2\n1.46\n1.79\n2.21\n2\n1.17\n1.38\n1.64\n1.96\n3\n1.15\n1.33\n1.65\n1.83\n1.15\n1.3\n1.5\n1.74\n5\n1.13\n1.28\n1.46\n1.67\n10\n1.1\n1.21\n1.34\n1.49\n20\n1.06\n1.13\n1.21\n1.29\n100\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\nCoefficient of Variation (COV) is derived from Standard Dev / Av for a group of tests.

For clip-fastened products, the applied depreciation factor may not be less than 1.3.\nThe number of units tested relates to the number of valid results derived from a given fastener configuration and\npurlin spacing.\nFor values between those listed in the table, interpolation may be used.\n17.1.5.2 \nInterpreting UDL Load Results \nWhen using data from testing for producing graphs, tables, or other design aids, the following conditions apply:\na.\nData must not be extrapolated except where a minimum of four span-combinations within the limitations\nof (b) below can be shown to provide a statistically reliable load span graph. In such cases, an\nextrapolation of a further 10% at either end may be calculated.\nb.\nInterpolation of data between different spans of a specific type of test is acceptable only in the following\ncircumstances:\n<i>\nWhere the data is taken from tests for a single type, size, and profile of cladding and type and\nspacing of fastener.\n<ii>\nWhere at least three different spans or support spacings have been tested for the same type, size,\nand profile of cladding and fastener details, and that in all three tests the failure mode was the\nsame.\n<iii> Where test loads were derived from the same test criteria.\nc.\nThe client may decide whether to publish deflection results. When published they may elect to:\n<i>\nPublish delfection under load as a measurement \n<ii>\nPublish deflection as pass/fail where pass is less than or equal to (span/120) + P/30, where P is the\nmaximum lateral distance between cladding fasteners.\n<iii> Both of the above.\n17.1.5.3 \nInterpreting Point Load Results \nPoint load requirement for trafficable roofs is defined in NZS 1170 as 1.1 kN, which approximates a 100 kg\nperson on one foot. (Note: many workers carrying tools or equipment exceed this limit.) To allow for statistical\nvariation this is factored by 20% and a test load of 1.32 kN is applied to give a pass/fail.\nType A roof (unrestricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load on the rib without\ndeformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType B roof (restricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load in the pan or over two ribs\nwithout deformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType C Roof (non-trafficable) is required to withstand a 0.6 kN test load to the pan or over two ribs, and a 1.1 kN\nstrength load.

Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\nLoad is applied in a downward direction through a rubber-faced pad. The weakest point is generally mid-span at\nthe rib/pan adjacent to the underlap.\n17.1.2.1 \nSupporting Structure and Equipment \n17.1.2.1A Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)\nThe design of the support system for wind load should consist of a rigid frame airbox, sealed on the bottom and\nfour sides. A fan or blower is required, capable of controlling and maintaining the required test pressure, and\npressure measuring devices. The deflection can be measured using several differential displacement transducers\nand traced and recorded coincidentally with the increasing load. Purlin and end wall positions can be changed to\ntest for multiple spans of different dimensions.\nThe use of airbags rather than air pressure is not endorsed by the MRM COP\nFor point load testing, a means of applying and measuring a continuously increasing load is positioned above the\npart of the material being tested. \n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n476\nThis is a controlled document.

This may be when pierce-fastened cladding pulls\nfasteners through the profile or clip fastened profile de-clips. Both these actions result in sudden and permanent\nloss of air pressure and terminate the test. The load at which this occurs, or maximum load achievable due to air\nleakage, is recorded.\nIf strength load limits cannot be attained by the testing apparatus, a load of at least 2.0 times the serviceability\nload must be imposed to demonstrate that the sample failure load is governed by serviceability rather than by\nstrength. If serviceability/strength ratios exceed 2.0 for at least two different spans, it may be assumed that the\nratio will be similar on all spans.\nFastener pull-out from testbed purlins is not recorded as a failure as this is independent of the profile strength\nand is relevant only to the condition of the purlin material on the testbed. Such fasteners may be replaced or\nrepositioned and the test recommenced.\n17.1.3.2 \nPoint Load Testing \nConcentrated load must be applied in a direction perpendicular to the roof through a circular steel disc of 100 mm\ndiameter faced with a 20 mm thick rubber pad, with a Shore A Durometer hardness of 30-70, to the part of the\nprofile judged to be least resistant to load.

For Type A\n(unrestricted access) and B roofs (restricted access), the load is increased to 1.32 kN, the pressure is released,\nand residual deflection is measured after 1 minute. Residual deflection must be less than S/1000 or 1.5 mm,\nwhichever is higher. The pressure is then increased to failure (or at least 2.41 kN) and noted.

The relationship between the rise and the\nhorizontal distance is known as the tangent of the angle and is calculated by using tan f = O/A (being the opposite\nside divided by the adjacent side). See 18.2 Pitch & Rise Calculator.\n18.7A Measuring Stick Method\n250/1000 = 0.25 = 14 deg (1 in 4)\nN.B.

If the depth of the cricket is half of the width of the penetration, as shown for 'Cricket X'\nthe angles are at 45 deg and there is a defined relationship between the length of the valley of the\ncricket and the width of the penetration and also between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and\nthe pitch of the roof.\nThis is 1 : 2 = 1.42, which means that to maintain the desired 3 deg fall in the cricket valley, the\nminimum roof pitch (4 deg ) can be calculated using table 15.8.\nIf the depth of the cricket is a quarter or a sixth of the width of the penetration, there are also\ndefined relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch of the roof.\nThese are described in table 18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket\nand the pitch of the roof as 'Cricket Y' and 'Cricket Z'.\nAll figures comply with the minimum fall of 1.5 deg , but all the bold figures will provide a 3 deg cricket\nvalley pitch. This methodology is valid for all sizes of penetration. However, there is a point at\nwhich, having a design with a wide penetration and a low pitch, it becomes uneconomic to pursue\nthe ideal 3 deg fall in the cricket valley. When the roof pitch is known, the minimum allowable fall of\nthe cricket valley pitch (1.5 deg ) can then be read from table 15.8.\nIt is permissible to lower the valley pitch because 1.5 deg allows sufficient fall to clear debris from the\nvalley and therefore qualifies as a warrantable flashing.\nA diverter flashing without a cricket design only shifts the position of the cricket to the top over-\nflashing of the penetration as shown on drawing 9.7.6B Cricket Flashings, unless the penetration\nis rotated 45 deg as shown on drawing 9.7.6C Diverter Flashings.\n18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch\nof the roof\nROOF PITCH\n3 deg \n4 deg \n5 deg \n6 deg \n7 deg \n8 deg \n9 deg \n10 deg \nTANGENT\n.0524\n.0699\n.0875\n.1051\n.1228\n.1405\n.1584\n1763\nCRICKET X\n2 deg \n3 deg \n3.5 deg \n4.5 deg \n10 deg \nCRICKET Y\n1.5 deg \n1.75 deg \n2.25 deg \n2.75 deg \n3.25 deg \n8 deg \n9 deg \n10 deg \nCRICKET Z\nn/a\nn/a\n1.5 deg \n2 deg \n2.25 deg \n2.5 deg \n3 deg \n3.5 deg \nPROCEDURE TO MAKE A HALF PATTERN FOR A CRICKET PENETRATION FLASHING\nExample:\nA net penetration width is 550 mm wide and gross width to the flat of the pans is 620 mm (2A).\n 18 \n 18.7 CRICKET PENETRATION PATTERNS\n 7 \n 18 \n 18.7 \n507\nThis is a controlled document.

This\nfactor adjusts 10-minute rainfall figures for higher short-term intensities. Non-residential roofs now match the 3.1\ndefault but can be adjusted down to 2.2 if needed.\nOther Notable Revisions\nWe edited 3.11.2 Steel Cladding Wind Load Span Graphs and 3.11 Wind Load/Span Graphs -\nDesigns to AS/NZS1170 to remove identical content in these two clauses. There were no changes to\nrecommendations and no information was deleted. A new sub-clause gives guidance on 3.11.1 Fastener Pull-\nout in SED situations.\nThe 2 Glossary now has added definitions for dunnage, straps, and strops.\nFor Internal Moisture 10.1.4 Compliance, we added an improved explanation of the compliance requirements of\nNZBC E3.3a. We similarly introduced improved guidance to 14.8.5 Stopends to aid clarity, with no changes to\nrecommendations.\nIn another bid to improve clarity, we replaced 'C1\" and \"C2\" designations in \n Minimum Flashing Cover with\n\"X\" and \"Y\" labels to reduce confusion.\nIn the 4.9.4 Compatibility Table, we revised the terminology for ZM Coated Steel to ZM/AM Coated Steel and\nmoved Pre-Painted ZM/AM Coated Steel to be directly after ZM/AM Coated Steel to make the table more\naccurate and more easily interpreted.\nThe rest of the updates and revisions consisted of minor edits for clarity, grammar, and spelling.

Substantial changes\ninclude removing wind load/span graphs for 0.70 mm aluminium.\nEditing and rearrangement updates involve updating and editing images for consistency, clarifying 7.3.2 Roof\nCladding Expansion Provisions, material thickness, and amending references to the availability of 4.16.1.6\nAM Coatings in New Zealand. Minor edits were made for grammar, style, clarity, and consistency.\nNotable revisions:\nWe removed the option of 0.70 mm Aluminium cladding from 3.11.3 Aluminium Cladding Wind Load\nSpan Graphs because 0.90 mm Aluminium is offered as a standard thickness.\nExperience showed that hot-dipped galvanised gutter support brackets are not as durable as pre-painted steel\nproducts. Therefore, we added some recommendations to improve the durability of 5.4.2.3 Spouting\nSupport Systems.\nAlthough not a change in recommendation, we added a statement to 10.10.1.3 Ridge Vents to help prevent\nnegative pressure in roof cavities.\nWe clarified the positioning of oversized holes and washers to aid in making 7.3.2 Roof Cladding\nExpansion Provisions.\nIn addition to these and some minor edits and rearrangements, several images have been revised for consistency.\nFor a detailed list of revisions, please visit 19.7 v24.06 June 2024.\n19.7A Revision Detail v24.06 - 2024 - June\nCategory\nClause\nNumber\n(prior to\nupdate)\nClause (As of current\npublication)\nDetails\n3 - Substantial\nchange to\nrecommendation\n5.4.2.3\n5.4.2.3 Spouting Support\nSystems\nClause renamed.
