The life of the building, being not less than 50 years, if:\nthose building elements (including floors, walls, and fixings) provide structural stability to the building; or\nthose building elements are difficult to access or replace; or\nfailure of those building elements to comply with the building code would go undetected during both\nnormal use and maintenance of the building.\nb. 15 years if:\nthose building elements (including the building envelope, exposed plumbing in the subfloor space, and in-\nbuilt chimneys and flues) are moderately difficult to access or replace; or\nfailure of those building elements to comply with the building code would go undetected during normal\nuse of the building, but would be easily detected during normal maintenance.\nc. 5 years if:\nthe building elements (including services, linings, renewable protective coatings, and fixtures) are easy to\naccess and replace; and\nfailure of those building elements to comply with the building code would be easily detected during normal\nuse of the building.\nIndividual building elements which are components of a building system and are difficult to access or replace\nmust either:\nall have the same durability; or\nbe installed in a manner that permits the replacement of building elements of lesser durability without\nremoving building elements that have greater durability and are not specifically designed for removal and\n 4.1 NZBC CLAUSE B2 (EXTRACT)\n 1 \n 4.1 \n99\nThis is a controlled document.

The COP recommends the\nhigher figure as good trade practice and in many cases, lower life-cycle costing.\nGenerally, higher durability than the minimum requirements can be achieved by using materials and methods\noutlined in this COP, with no maintenance of coatings other than washing areas which are not naturally washed by\nrain. Elements more difficult to replace, or to access for maintenance, should be constructed of more durable\nmaterial.\nNormal Maintenance means work recognised as being necessary to achieve the expected durability of a given\nbuilding element.\nAccording to B2/AS1, normal maintenance may include:\nWashing down surfaces subject to wind-driven salt spray and contaminants.\nRe-coating protective surfaces.\nReplacing sealant seals and gaskets in joints.\nAlthough roof or wall cladding can be easily accessed and therefore easily replaced, the same cannot be\nassumed for flashings. Flashings might be embedded in plaster or behind other building elements, making them\nhard to replace without removing cladding or other building features such as windows.\nCladding material may be described as hidden, sheltered or exposed. Some flashings may have sections falling\ninto all these categories, in which case the worst case (sheltered) should prevail in material selection.\nAll metal roof and wall cladding and accessories must be designed and installed to comply with the\ndurability requirements of the NZBC. NZBC requirements relate to performance, however, and do not\nnecessarily relate to aesthetics or cost of replacement. Any pre-painted cladding will change colour over\ntime, and partial replacement would be visible. The roof cladding could have deteriorated, although not\nperforated, within 15 years and still comply with the NZBC, but customer expectations may not be met.\nGood design, correct selection of materials, and good installation and maintenance practices are required to\nachieve optimum product lifespan. \n 4.1 NZBC CLAUSE B2 (EXTRACT)\n 1 \n 4.1 \n101\nThis is a controlled document.

The red rusting of iron and\nsteel is a visible example of corrosion and other examples include the weathering of copper and the\noxidation of aluminium and zinc.\nCorrosion can only happen in the presence of an electrolyte, e.g., water. The occurrence of salt (or other\ncontaminants) in the water increases the conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore greatly increases\nthe reaction rate.\nSalt contamination will also affect the time of wetness. On a clean surface, water vapour will condense\nat 100% relative humidity; on a salt-covered surface, a wet film can be formed at a relative humidity\nlevel of 75% or more.\nCorrosion can also be the result of direct contact with another metal or substance, the result of run-off\nfrom incompatible surfaces or the fall-out of corrosive particles. Time of wetness, presence or lack of\noxygen, and atmospheric contaminants greatly affect the rate of corrosion.\nDifferences in electrical potential on the surface of corroding metal create microscopic cells comprising\ncathodes and anodes. In the case of iron, the positively charged electrons in the anode react with the\nnegatively charged hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte to form iron oxide on the anode. Similar reactions\noccur with other metals. Polarisation changes on the surface cause anodic areas to become cathodic and\nvice versa, so over time, the rate of corrosion is relatively uniform over the surface.\nThe build-up of debris on a cladding surface will promote corrosion. The salts in the debris react with the\ncladding each time they are wetted, and the deposits themselves impede surface drying, increasing the\ntime of wetness.\n 4.2 METAL CORROSION\n 2 \n 4.2 \n102\nThis is a controlled document.

By coating steel with zinc, or a zinc-rich product, the zinc\nbecomes the anode for the steel. The steel then becomes the cathode and does not react with the\nelectrolyte. The process is known as cathodic protection.\nThis protective effect occurs even when there is a small area of steel exposed directly to the electrolyte,\nsuch as a cut sheet edge, drill hole or scratch.\nWhile the zinc reacts in preference to the steel, it does so at a slower rate. In normal environmental\nconditions, the zinc oxide layer that initially forms on the surface of the zinc combines with carbon\ndioxide in the atmosphere to form zinc carbonate. That creates a sealed layer with excellent adhesion,\nand as zinc carbonate has very low solubility, reaction with the electrolyte slows even more.\n4.4.2 \nBarrier Protection \nBarrier protection works primarily by providing a physical barrier between the atmosphere and the steel substrate.\nThe surface of aluminium-dominant coatings is initially very active, but it quickly forms an inert aluminium-oxide\nfilm when exposed to normal atmospheric conditions. Aluminium dominant coatings on steel mainly provide\nbarrier protection as the aluminium, having formed an oxide surface, ceases to offer substantial sacrificial\nprotection.\nThe exposed edges of barrier protected cladding should not be in contact with corrosive surfaces. See 4.9.4\nCompatibility Table\n 4.4 SACRIFICIAL AND BARRIER PROTECTION\n 4.4 \n105\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.5 \nThe Environment \n4.5.1 \nAtmosphere \nThe durability performance of metal roof and wall cladding depends on the macro- and microclimates,\nairborne contaminants, and the material itself.\nThe macroclimate is the general environmental category where the building is situated.\nThe microclimate relates to the exact location of the building and the design or position on the roof\nor wall. Microclimate influences include geothermal fumaroles, rain sheltering, topography and\nground roughness, prolonged wetness, and exclusion of oxygen. Internal microclimates can also\noccur as result of the particular use of the building.\nContaminants and pollutants are corrosive influences which can affect the cladding. These can\ninclude fertiliser, soil, leaf fall-out, exhaust fumes, industrial fumes, bird droppings and the build-\nup of debris. Influences such as chlorides near the sea, geothermal hydrogen sulphide (H S) or\nman-made gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO ) accelerate the corrosion rate by increasing the\nconductivity of the electrolyte and changing its pH value.\nRain provides the moisture that acts as the electrolyte in corrosion cells. Rain varies in pH because\nit picks up various contaminants from the pollutants in the atmosphere. Acid rain can happen in\ngeothermal areas due to the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the atmosphere.\nAt 0 deg C metal corrosion is minimal, because colder temperatures slow the reaction. The corrosion\nrate of some metals doubles with every 10 deg C rise in temperature given the same time of wetness and\nenvironmental conditions. However, in dry, warm environments the time of wetness is decreased by\nfaster drying times, which has the opposite effect.\nDesigners should be aware of macro- and microclimates and the degree of contamination. They should\ndesign their building and select materials considering a combination of all these factors.\n4.5.2 \nSea Spray \nThe major contributor to metal corrosion in New Zealand is sea spray. Seaspray contains a mixture of salts\nconsisting of 2.5 to 4% sodium chloride and small quantities of magnesium, calcium and potassium chloride.\nThese salts make water far more electrically conductive and, therefore, will cause more corrosion.\nSeaspray, evaporation, and infrequent rain increase salt concentrations on exterior surfaces, particularly when it\naccumulates in unwashed areas.\n2\n2\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n106\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.5.2A Airborne Salt from Sea Spray.\nOnshore winds, big swells, wide generation zones and rugged coastline make ideal conditions for the production of\nsalt aerosol.\nThe distance airborne salt is carried inland varies significantly with local wind patterns. Salt deposits have been\nmeasured as far inland as Lake Taupo in the North Island. Geographic or man-made obstructions, such as trees\nor buildings, slow air velocity and allow the air to discharge some of its salt burden, which can make the\nenvironment less aggressive. Conversely, where there are few impediments to the free flow of air, severe marine\ninfluence can extend well inland.\nIn high humidity levels, or when wetted by condensation, marine salts absorb water and form a chloride solution.\nTherefore, the effect of salt spray is greatest in unwashed areas, where salts can accumulate over time.\nWhere the ends of roof cladding are exposed to contaminants such as sea salt or industrial pollutants, it is good\npractice to provide an over-flashing which discharges into the gutter or spouting. (See 8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves\nFlashing Option 1.)\nIt gives a measure of protection to the underside of the roof cladding and the underlay.\nIt provides support for the roofing underlay which is subject to damage from wind and UV.\nWhen using PVC spouting, there is a gap between the spouting and the fascia caused by the thickness of the\nbrackets. In coastal locations where the ends of roof cladding are exposed, this unwashed area becomes\nsusceptible to corrosion. A gutter apron can minimise this risk.\nIf there is no spouting or it has a low front.\nIn severe environments, wind can drive contaminants up the ribs of exposed ends of roof cladding. Metal\nscriber flashings or filler blocks can be used to prevent or inhibit ventilation.\nThe over-flashing should extend 50 mm into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the\nflashing. If there is no over-flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a minimum of\n20 mm.\nIn some cases, the over-flashing becomes a sacrificial flashing which can extend the life of the cladding. In such\ncircumstances, the COP recommends making the flashing from aluminium.\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n107\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\n4.6 \nEnvironmental Categories \nSuppliers of pre-painted metal offer alternative products for different environments, using different\nmetallic coatings, paint systems, paint thickness and metals. The designer or the roof cladding contractor\nshould carefully assess and evaluate these options to comply with the NZBC.\nThe boundaries of different corrosion zones are difficult to define because many factors determine the\ncorrosivity of a particular location. The designer should choose the appropriate materials for the location.\nThe chosen materials should meet the minimum durability requirements of the NZBC and satisfy\ncustomer expectations.\n4.6.1 \nAssessment of Marine Environments \nWind is responsible for the salinity present in marine atmospheres. The wind picks up particles of salt\nfrom breaking waves and can carry them inland. The quantity of salt aerosol entrained by the wind is\naffected by many factors, such as wind strength, wave height, the width of the generation zone, and the\ncontours of the seabed and coastline. These factors along with the persistence of the wind from a given\nquarter determine the corrosivity of a shoreline.\nWhile salt deposits are measurably present in inland areas such as Taupo, the main effect of marine\natmospheres reaches just a few hundred metres from the shore. Particles of salt in the air deposit on\nadjacent surfaces through gravity and contact; the rate at which deposits settle is affected by the\nroughness of the ground that the salt-laden air passes over. Obstacles such as trees slow the wind down,\nincreasing the rate of gravitational deposit, and bringing the salt aerosol in more contact with surfaces\non which they can deposit.\nOn the other hand, open flat land and natural \"wind tunnels\" can allow quite high concentrations of salt\nto travel several hundred metres inland.\nA site's location, relative to the sea or marine inlets, is a common method used to assess the corrosivity\nof a location. The distance from salt water for a given Zone varies with the location, depending on the\nprevailing winds and roughness of water in those areas, as well as the evenness of the terrain it passes\nover.\nWhere environmental Zones overlap, a site-specific evaluation may help define the category into which\nit best fits. Visual evidence of corrosion on adjacent metal surfaces may be present, ground roughness\ncan be assessed, industrial influences can be evaluated and data about the persistence of onshore\nwinds can be obtained from NIWA.\nMore local factors that affect the corrosivity of a specific location include:\nOverhanging shade increases the time of wetness of a structure and corrosion rate.\nHigh levels of water roughness such as caused by strong tidal flow against the wind direction, as is\noften experienced in areas such as Cook Strait, increases salt spray.\nSurfaces not receiving regular and effective rain washing or sufficient manual washing may\nexperience corrosion rates two to three times that of cleaned surfaces.\n 4.6 ENVIRONMENTAL CATEGORIES\n 6 \n 4.6 \n108\nThis is a controlled document.

The most\ncommonly accepted method as outlined in ISO 9223 is measuring first-year corrosion rate of different\nmetals: mild steel (MS), zinc, aluminium and copper. The COP uses the first-year corrosion rate of mild\nsteel as the most relevant and reliable indicator of a location's corrosivity.\nThe names given by different Standards for specified corrosion zones vary. The Corrosion Zones in the\nCode of Practice are similar to those published in NZS 3604:2011 except that:\nthe COP makes a distinction between Harbours, West Coast, and East Coast shorelines, and\nNZS 3604 Zone D (High) is further broken down into E (Very High) and F (Extreme Marine) because, in\nNZS 3604 Zone D, the first-year mild steel corrosion rate can vary from 200 g/m to 1000 g/m .\n4.6.1A Corrosion Zone Categorisation and First year Mild Steel Corrosion Rate\n(g/m)\nNZS3604 Code of\nPractice\nDescription\nMS\nCorrosion\nRate\n(g/m)\nB\nA (Mild)\nFar inland, with no industrial pollution or thermal activity, or\ndry internal.

These include:\ncovered swimming pools;\nfertiliser works;\nmeat works;\nanimal sheds or shelters;\npulp and paper manufacturing; and\nvehicle exhaust fumes.\n4.7.4 \nFossil Fuel Residue \nSulphur dioxide develops when burning fossil fuels. After oxidation and reaction with water it forms sulphuric acid\n(H SO ) that can contribute considerably to the atmospheric corrosion of zinc and steel.\nBurning resinous woods, CCA-treated timber, low-grade coal or oils with a high sulphur content can increase the\nfall-out deposit or condensate from flue gas.\nExhaust fans can cause similar problems when corrosive gases are not filtered at their source.\n2\n 4.7 SPECIAL CLIMATES\n 7 \n 4.7 \n115\nThis is a controlled document.

Proprietary pre-painted cladding\nproducts should give durability protection and keep its appearance for at least 15 years, and at the end of that\nperiod still have the anti-corrosive primers intact and present a good substrate for over-painting.\nThe performance of all paint coatings, however, can be affected by avoidable outside influences.\n4.8.1 \nTouch-up Paint \nColour match paint is sold in pre-colour matching accessories, such as soft edging or brackets, to match the pre-\npainted cladding. It should only be pre-applied before installation and should not be used to repair minor\nscratches and blemishes. These paints may closely match the pre-painted surface initially, but being an air drying\nacrylic, it is likely to weather differently to the pre-applied coating and cause unsightly blotches.\n4.8.1A Touch-up Paint Weathering\n4.8.2 \nSunscreen Lotions \nSun screen lotions containing semi conducting metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, will cause\ndiscoloration of painted surfaces over time. There is no cure for such damage so contact of such chemicals with\npre-painted cladding must be avoided.\n 4.8 PAINT DURABILITY\n 8 \n 4.8 \n116\nThis is a controlled document.

It is\ngenerally difficult to remove graffiti without compromising an existing organic finish; the normal remedy is to\noverpaint as soon as possible. On a weathered pre-painted finish this can generally be achieved by washing and\nrinsing the surface to remove dirt and other contaminants, then applying two coats of acrylic paint.\nIt should be noted that such overpaint cannot, over time, be expected to match the appearance of existing pre-\napplied finishes.\n4.8.4 \nLichen \nWarm temperatures, dust, and rainfall can create an environment for lichens to flourish. Over time the root\nstructures of lichen may infiltrate a painted surface and cause permanent damage.\n 4.8 PAINT DURABILITY\n 8 \n 4.8 \n117\nThis is a controlled document.

They are fed by nutrients in the\natmosphere and tend to occur more commonly in moist and unpolluted environments. Where lichen growth is\npresent, it should be removed. See 16 Maintenance .\nPhysical removal is difficult to achieve completely, and recolonisation is usually rapid. Chemical treatment is\nrecommended. New Zealand Steel publishes a formula for batching a 2% sodium Hypochlorite solution to be\nused for this.\n4.8.4A Lichen on a Metal Roof\n4.8.4B Permanent Damage from Lichen\nGrowth\nLichen growth can cause permanent damage if not\ntreated promptly\n 4.8 PAINT DURABILITY\n 8 \n 4.8 \n118\nThis is a controlled document.

When a noble metal dissolves in water and flows over a less noble one, the\nmore noble metal deposits on the less noble metal and create corrosion conditions.\n4.9.1A Galvanic Series\nGalvanic Series\nMagnesium\nActive (Anode)\nZinc\nGalvanised Steel\nAluminium\nMild Steel\nCast Iron\nLead\nBrass\nCopper\nBronze\nMonel\nNickel (passive)\nStainless Steel 304 (passive)\nStainless Steel 316 (passive)\nSilver\nTitanium\nGold\nGraphite\nPlatinum\nNoble (Cathode)\nThe similarity of metals is indicated by their relative position in the galvanic series. The more\ndissimilar the metals, the greater the corrosion potential in a galvanic circuit\nGenerally, run-off from metals higher on the table to those lower will not cause corrosion, but run-off in the other\ndirection may do so.\n 4.9 COMPATIBILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n119\nThis is a controlled document.

However, because these surfaces are\ninert, potential for run-off to create inert catchment corrosion on unpainted zinc or galvanised steel must be\nconsidered.\n4.9.1B Lead in Contact with AZ\n 4.9 COMPATIBILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n120\nThis is a controlled document.

Long-term corrosion resistance depends on the separation remaining effective.\nExamples of separation materials are inert plastic tapes, polythene or silicone sealant, and in the case of\nfasteners an EPDM sealing washer.\nWhere gutters and spouting are made from materials incompatible with the roof cladding, there can be\ncontamination from immersion of the sheet ends if the gutter is poorly drained. Special provisions, such as\nensuring there is a 10 mm drainage gap between spouting and fascia should be made to avoid immersion of\ncoated steel roofing into copper gutters. Discharging the gutter into a rain head with a leaf deflector can also\nhelp. Low front spouting can be considered, but that creates aesthetic issues and may contribute to early\ncorrosion in marine areas. No part of copper gutters should be in contact with coated steel roofing or flashings.\n4.9.2 \nThe Electrochemical or Galvanic Series \nThe electrochemical tables or galvanic series scales, often quoted in technical literature as a measure of\ncorrosion, show the electro-potential between pure metals, not between their oxides, carbonates or chlorides.\n 4.9 COMPATIBILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n122\nThis is a controlled document.

Under certain conditions, some metals react with the environment or\nchemicals to form a passive surface, which renders them less active, so that any ranking can be misleading.\n\"Passivity\" becomes an important phenomenon in controlling corrosion rates.\nHowever, the Electrochemical series table is still a useful indicator of electrode potential. The further apart two\nmetals are in the electrochemical series, the greater the potential difference between them.\nMetals termed anodic, active, negative, or less noble corrode in preference to metals that are deemed more\ncathodic, noble, positive or less active. The less noble metal becomes the anode and is subject to corrosion. The\ngreater the potential difference, the more corrosion there will be of the less noble metal; i.e., on the anode.\nThe difference in nobility is why zinc can protect a steel substrate.\nDifferent electrolytes can lead to different rankings, and metal alloys may display more than one potential than\nthat which applies to their \"active\" state.\nThe exposed surface ratio of anode and cathode determines the rate of dissimilar metal corrosion. For instance,\nif a fastener which has a small surface compared to the cladding becomes the anode, its current density will be\nhigh, and the fastener will corrode quickly; e.g., an aluminium rivet in a copper sheet. When the opposite is the\ncase, the effect is not so great.\nThe 4.9.2A Electrochemical table shows zinc is more active than steel. Contact between steel and zinc, in\nthe presence of moisture, will cause the zinc to corrode or sacrifice itself, to protect the steel.\n 4.9 COMPATIBILITY\n 9 \n 4.9 \n123\nThis is a controlled document.

When\ncondensation, dew or humidity moistens these particles, they react with metal cladding. The reaction is often\nnoticeable as a white zinc corrosion effect, which will precede more serious corrosion.\nAn unwashed or sheltered area is any surface that is above or inside a line drawn at 45 deg to any weathertight\noverhang. Such areas require special consideration, particularly in severe environments.\nUnwashed areas include: unlined soffits, roof overhangs, canopies, sheltered walls, and the upper part of garage\ndoors.\nWall claddings receive less effective rain washing than roofs, and may be harder to maintain or replace, so\nmaterials for wall cladding should be selected accordingly.\n4.10.1A Unwashed Soffits\nUnwashed soffits \ncomprising areas of main \nroof are best avoided\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n128\nThis is a controlled document.

Birds can\nalso deposit other injurious material, eg, fish frames and chicken bones.\n4.10.3 \nSolar Collectors and Other Roof Mounted Structures \nSolar energy collectors, Heating Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may be attached directly to the\nsurface of profiled metal roof cladding or mounted on a frame above the roof plane.\nFor direct fastened solar energy collectors, a complete seal between the photovoltaic (PV) cells and the cladding\nis essential to prevent water ingress resulting in wet storage corrosion.\nRail-mounted systems for solar energy collectors can be installed in a similar manner to HVAC systems and\nother roof-mounted structures. Units may be laid parallel to the roof or oriented at an angle for greater efficiency\nand easier roof maintenance.\nSupport frames installed above the roof must have sufficient gap underneath\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n130\nThis is a controlled document.

A greater\nclearance may be required for larger installations or where greater debris deposits are expected.\nThe support structure may be connected to the rib of clip-fixed products, or supported by the rib and attached\nthrough the profile to the purlins. The designer must ensure that the design of the roof and the structure is\nadequate to resist any additional wind and gravity loads associated with the panels.\nAccess to the roof for inspection and maintenance must be considered when designing roof-mounted structures.\nThe roof cladding should be designed to resist regular roof traffic, or the installation of walkways is\nrecommended.\nWires and conduits penetrating the cladding must be fitted with a gooseneck or proprietary cover to prevent\nreliance on sealant for weatherproofness and must be installed so that their base does not impede water flow.\n4.10.3A Clamp Style Fixing Bracket\n4.10.3B Purlin Fixing Bracket\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n131\nThis is a controlled document.

Typical proprietary support structures are\nmanufactured from aluminium with stainless steel fasteners. Contact between the stainless fasteners and the\nroof cladding should be avoided, but run-off is acceptable. Contact with, or run-off from, copper onto painted and\nunpainted steel and aluminium roofs must be avoided.\n4.10.4 \n4.10.3C Proprietary Cable Hood\nPVC Cap\nSlotted PVC Pipe\nDektite\nRoofing Screws\nSealant\nBoot Flashing\n4.10.3D Supported HVAC Installation\nA well-designed HVAC installation allows free draining of\nwater, isolates incompatible materials, has little reliance\non sealant and avoids extensive dry-pan back flashings\n4.10.3E Rib Supported Photovoltaic\nBracket\nTypical rib-supported systems are Manufactured from\naluminium.\n4.10.3F Tilted Photovoltaic Installation\nAn example of a proprietary tilted PV Installation.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n132\nThis is a controlled document.

The copper pipes of solar panels, air-conditioning or other ancillary\nequipment must be sealed to avoid runoff onto any metal cladding or gutters other than copper.\n4.10.5 \nWalkways \nOnly aluminium, stainless steel, inert plastic, or hot-dipped galvanized steel framing members are\nacceptable for support structures above steel cladding and must be supported by the structural\nmembers or across the ribs of the profile adjacent to the ribs. They should be designed to allow natural\nrain washing of the roof underneath.\n4.10.6 \nCapillary Action \nWhile capillary action is both a durability and a weather-tightness issue, it is considered here because it affects\ndurability more often than water tightness, although the two are interrelated.\nCapillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow into narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition\nto, external forces such as gravity. It is caused by the combination of intermolecular forces of surface tension in\nthe water and adhesive forces between the liquid and surrounding surfaces.\nCapillary action can be seen when liquid is drawn up between the bristles of a paintbrush, in absorbent materials\nsuch as blotting paper or a sponge, in a burning candle, a fountain pen, or in the cells of a tree. The effect can\noccur in a tube, but also between two closely spaced mating surfaces.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n133\nThis is a controlled document.

Closely stacked sheets of trapezoidal or corrugate profiles, or flat sheet that has the sheet ends\nexposed to rain, will draw water between the surfaces which can infiltrate a long way into the stack of\nmaterial. After a short time in the absence of air, it can form volatile corrosive products which are\nunsightly and detrimental to product life.\nWhile metallic coatings have temporary surface protection against wet storage stain and organic\ncoatings also give some protection, there is no hard and fast rule as to how long this will last; it is up\nto the roofing contractor to take appropriate measures. Packs of close stacked sheets exposed to\nwater must be fillet or cross stacked to allow natural air movement and drying, before the onset of\nwet storage stain.\n2. Capillary action can take place in the side lap of roofing sheets, or between a longitudinal flashing and\nthe adjacent rib. For this reason, side laps should be designed with a capillary break, and when\ncalculating the water carrying capacity of a profile, the allowable water depth is taken as being to the\nbottom of the capillary bead, not the rib height. \nEven corrugate profiles are designed to have an asymmetrical shape between under and over crest.\nHowever, this is not normally as effective as the capillary break on a rib profile. This is one of the\nreasons why the minimum pitch for standard corrugate is 8 deg , although it has been proven to perform\nat lower pitches in short runs if the dimension of the overlap is not too generous and it is not\nextending into the water table.\nWith longitudinal flashings, such as barges, the downturn into the pan should not be tight against the\nrib, but have a gap to avoid capillary action from occurring.\n3. Capillary action is also common between the end laps of sheets. When short-run sheets were the\nnorm and end laps were common, the onset of corrosion normally occurred around the lap, despite\nprimer being applied to the surfaces. It was most often concentrated on the upper end of the lap and\nwas caused not by rainwater but by condensation on the underside of the sheet entering the lap.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n134\nThis is a controlled document.

End laps on roofing should be avoided where possible. Where they do occur, end laps must be sealed\nat both ends to avoid ingress of moisture from both internal condensation and external rainfall, and\nend laps in vertical sheets must be sealed at the top end of the lap.\n4.10.6B Roofing Sheet End Lap\nSilicon sealant or lap \ntape at both ends of \nthe lap\n5. The adhesive nature of water that causes capillary action can help drive water up the underside of\nthe sheets at the eaves, rather than discharging into the gutter. Therefore, the ends of all sheets laid\nto a fall less than 8 deg require a drip edge; and the minimum roof pitch of standard corrugate is 8 deg , as it\nis difficult to form a drip edge in that profile.The lower edge of all roofing sheets and flashings laid to a\nfall of less than 8 deg must be drip formed into the gutter to prevent capillary action. \n4.10.7 \nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain \nRoofing materials exposed to the air react with the atmosphere to form a relatively stable surface. Exposing\nmetals to water in the absence air causes the formation of unstable surface films.\nCrevice corrosion occurs in crevices and confined spaces. Crevices are often created because of overlapping\nflashing or sheets of cladding, or between the sheets of close stacked materials.\nDesign details that trap moisture, dirt, and debris should be avoided.\nCorrosion can appear even with a chemically neutral electrolyte. An example of this type of corrosion is the\ncorrosion on metals underneath paint coatings and \"white rust\" - the wet storage stain on closely nested zinc\ncoated roofing sheets.

On metallic-coated steel sheets, the passivation\ncoating gives some temporary protection against this process, as do organic coatings, but longevity cannot be\nguaranteed for the duration of this protection. On non-ferrous, metals, wet storage stain can commence very\nrapidly.\nWet packs of sheets should be separated to allow surfaces to dry before substantial storage.\nIf wet storage stain appears on unpainted surfaces, the degree of erosion of the metallic surface may be slight\ndespite the bulky appearance of the deposits. However, when left unchecked it, can quite quickly lead to\nsubstantial degradation. If required, measurements can be taken of the thickness of the material or the metallic\ncoating to determine the extent of erosion.\nEven if the damage is superficial, the white deposits must be removed to allow exposure to the air to allow the\nnormal formation of stable surface films. Use a stiff bristle brush; wire brushes are not recommended as they\nwill remove more of the protective coating.\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n137\nThis is a controlled document.

It can lead to premature corrosion failure.\nThe test requirement for paint adhesion in AS/NZS 2728 and by the NZMRM is a bend test over a nominated\nnumber of material thicknesses (T) and it is measured as the internal diameter.\nThe radius required to avoid microcracking on metallic coated and pre-painted steel is measured externally. To\nobtain an external radius, add two material thicknesses to the internal diameter, and divide the result by two.\n4.10.8A Microcracking : a\n(a)\n0 T internal diameter = 1.0 T external radius\n4.10.8B Microcracking : b\n(b)\n(b) 1 T internal diameter = 1.5 T external radius\n4.10.8C Microcracking : c\n(c)\n(c) 2 T internal diameter = 2.0 T external radius\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n138\nThis is a controlled document.

They may\nachieve this objective, but instead they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the eaves line of\nthe roof.\nThat can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly increased time of wetness, and\nprevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\nThe COP recommends against the installation of such products. Alternative solutions include fitting a durable\nspouting material such as copper, installing rain heads with a leaf trap, or installing a proprietary leaf-proof\nspouting system.\nA printable bulletin concerning proprietary leaf guards is available\nat: BGLG01 Using Propietary Leaf Guards.\nExtract:\n\"Leaf guards are widely marketed as a way to prevent the build-up of vegetable matter in spouting.\nThey may achieve this objective, but they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the\neaves line of the roof which can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly\nincreased time of wetness, and prevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\"\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n139\nThis is a controlled document.

This is known as 'drip-spot corrosion' or inert catchment corrosion.\n4.11A Localised Damage due to Inert Catchment\nWater sitting on a surface absorbs carbon dioxide, forming carbonic acid, which is reactive with zinc. On a\ngalvanised surface, the carbonic acid reacts with the zinc and becomes neutral. On an inert surface discharging\ninto an unprotected zinc surface, the carbonic acid is not neutralised, and the reaction will be concentrated on the\ndrip points of the inert surface onto the zinc surface.\nAs the formation of carbonic acid takes time to occur, inert catchment corrosion is normally seen at specific drip\npoints of dew off a roof, rather than below rain-washed painted walls and windows.\n 4.11 INERT CATCHMENT\n 11 \n 4.11 \n143\nThis is a controlled document.

Possible causes include lack of fall, poor\npenetration design, and damage to sheet ribs due to excessive spans or foot traffic. The accumulated water\nincreases the time of wetness and can lead to poultice corrosion.\nAll paint systems on factory pre-painted materials are permeable to a degree and will delay, but not prevent, the\ncorrosive effects of ponding.\nPonding can occur in gutters and spouting when joints or outlets are higher than the sole of the gutter, or when\ndebris accumulates.\nTo help prevent ponding, the minimum pitch for all metal roof cladding in New Zealand is set at 3 deg . At pitches of\nlesser pitches deflection of the structural members or settlement of the building can compromise drainage.\nLow-pitch roof spans must be sized according to the type and frequency of roof traffic to prevent ponding caused\nby rib damage, and penetration flashings must be free-draining.\n 4.12 PONDING\n 12 \n 4.12 \n145\nThis is a controlled document.

When the break-through occurs in the passive film, the actively corroding pit\nconstitutes the anode and the large passive film surrounding the pit acts as a cathodic surface.\nThe rate of dissolution of the metal is strongly influenced by the ratio between anode and cathode areas,\nconsequently, the \"driving force\" behind the pitting attack can be very strong and deterioration can spread quickly.\n 4.13 PITTING CORROSION\n 13 \n 4.13 \n146\nThis is a controlled document.

These stains\nare often mistaken for early deterioration of the cladding.\nTo some degree, swarf will normally be evident at the completion of any roof cladding job. The acceptability of\nswarf depends on how it got there, whether techniques have been applied to minimize it, and the visual exposure\nof the cladding.\nSwarf created by acceptable means of cutting - i.e., power drills, self-drilling screws and shears - will be either\nloose or lightly adhered to the surface film of painted or unpainted sheets. Most swarf can be removed by daily\nhosing, sweeping, or blowing which should be done at the end of each day and at the completion of the job. \nAvoid blowing loose swarf under adjacent cover flashings.\nAny remaining swarf will not be in contact with the metallic substrate and will not cause deterioration of the roof,\nits effect is aesthetic only. Overly aggressive efforts to remove such swarf is likely to damage the appearance of\nthe cladding without enhancing its durability\nOn highly visible surfaces, a soft rag and plastic spatula can be used to remove more tenacious swarf adhesions\nor a diluted mild household cleaner might work on painted surfaces. Wire brushing, steel wool, or pot scouring\ncloths must not be used as they will damage the organic or metallic coating.\nBulletin available: BSCE01 Cut Edge Treatment:\n4.14A Light Scattered Swarf\nLight, scattered swarf is acceptable in most situations.\n4.14B Excessive Swarf\n 4.14 SWARF STAINING AND CUT EDGE CORROSION\n 14 \n 4.14 \n147\nThis is a controlled document.

The heat may cause it to embed deeply in the organic\nfilm and be in contact with the protective metallic substrate.\n4.14C Friction Cut Edge\nFriction cutting that creates swarf can also cause heat damage to metallic and organic protective surfaces.\nThis can severely affect the substrate; removal is difficult or impossible to achieve without mechanically\ndamaging the decorative and/or protective coatings.\nSwarf is not the only problem that cutting with friction blades can create. Such blades will often produce\nexcessive heat at the cutting edge, which will degrade the organic and metallic coatings.\n 4.14 SWARF STAINING AND CUT EDGE CORROSION\n 14 \n 4.14 \n148\nThis is a controlled document.

Similarly, the\nedges of cladding running parallel to flashings, such as at a window head, should have clearance to avoid\nmechanical damage and allow drainage.\nHaving the lower edges of flashings apart from the surface they cover helps to improve the cut edge durability of\nthe flashing. Kick-out barge details are preferred to bird's beak barge details for the same reason. The size of the\nclearance is not critical, but typically it is more than 5 mm.\nFor vermin flashings, both the clearance and the slope should be minimised to ensure the opening size at crest\nlevel does not exceed 7 mm.\n4.15A Window Head\nUnderlay or \nsynthetic \nwrap\nUnderlay\nTypically 3.5 cm\n20 mm batten\n4.15.1 \nGround Clearance \nClearance is required between the bottom of profiled metal cladding and large flat surfaces.

This\nmay take the form of a 3 to 6 mm gap, an inert self-adhesive tape or a PVC vermin strip.\nInternal environments are also important, ventilation must be adequate for the building use, and absorptive of\ncorrosive substances must not be in prolonged contact with the external or internal face of the cladding or\nstructure.\n4.15.2A Cladding Open to Air\nCladding which is open to air will experience the\nnormal wet/dry cycles for which it is designed.\n4.15.2B Vegetation in Contact with\nCladding\nVegetation or earth in contact with the cladding will\nincrease the time of wetness and may contain corrosive\ncompounds.\n 4.15 CLEARANCES\n 15 \n 4.15 \n152\nThis is a controlled document.

It works by the zinc\nsacrificing preferentially to the steel.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, research looked for metallic coatings which would provide longer life.\nAluminium was tried as a coating material because of its passive surface, but it was not satisfactory on its own.\nHowever, aluminium alloyed with zinc and other metals produced more corrosion-proof products than any metal\non its own. (See 4.4.2 Barrier Protection.)\nWe now have two groups of metallic coatings for steel cladding products - zinc-dominant coatings, which\nprimarily provide sacrificial protection; and aluminium-dominant coatings, which primarily provide a barrier\nprotective coating of aluminium oxide. Coatings containing both aluminium and zinc are now the preferred\ncoating for roof and wall cladding products, although zinc-based coatings continue to predominate for various\nother products.\nThe composition and weights of these coatings are described in detail in AS 1397:2011. The following sections\ndiscuss metallic coatings in the order in which they appear in AS 1397, not their rate of use in the market.\n4.16.1.1.1 \nCoating Thickness \nSteel was zinc-coated for many years by dipping short lengths of flat or profiled sheet metal in a bath of molten\nzinc, and the steel was then hung to cool while the excess zinc coating drained off.\nMore than sixty years ago manufacturers developed a continuous hot dipping method. During the continuous hot\ndipping process, the steel coil is run through a bath of molten metal. The thickness is controlled by blowing off\nthe excess coating with air jets applied to both sides of the strip as it leaves the molten metal bath. \nContinuous hot dipping, as opposed to the batch immersion process, is more cost-effective and allows for\ngreater control of the consistency, thickness, and surface condition of the metallic coating.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n154\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nIt is a similar process to that for continuous paint coating, shown in 4.18.1.1 The Paintline Process, with\npriming, coating, and ovens replaced by the molten metal tank and blow-off section.\nT he atmospheric corrosion performance of a hot-dipped zinc coating is closely proportional to its\nthickness.\nThe thickness of coatings in micrometres (m) can be measured with a non-destructive magnetic induction\nmeter or similar device which can then be converted into grams per square metre (g/m).\n4.16.1.1.1A Coating Thickness\nA= 225 gm/m2\nA\nB\nB = 225 gm/m2\nA+ B = 450 gm/m2\n1m\n1m\nThere is confusion about the method of describing the coating thickness of coil-coated sheet and strip products\nin g/m, compared to products that were hot-dipped after fabrication. The coating thickness of sheet and strip\nrefers to the collective amount of coating on both sides of the sheet, effectively dividing the coating weight by\nhalf. It is invalid to equate the coating weight in g/m of hot-dipped zinc coatings on fabricated products, such as\nnails and screws, with that of metallic coatings on sheet and coil; the coating thickness of the fabricated\nproducts relates to one surface only.\nA micron (m) is one-thousandth of a millimetre.\n4.16.1.2 \nGalvanised Steel \nZinc Coating, commonly called galvanising, is still one of the most common metallic coating processes for steel.\nGalvanising describes various methods of adding a metallic zinc coating to steel to give it cathodic protection;\nalso known as galvanic protection.\nGalvanised steel is classed as a \"Z\"-coating and has a bold crystalline pattern or spangle, a random geometric\npattern that resembles frost on a window.\nThere are many processes for galvanising, but only products dipped or immersed in a bath of molten zinc can be\ncalled hot-dipped galvanised, the process used for the metallic coating of steel roof and wall cladding.\nThe thickness of the coating can be more precisely controlled on a continuous coil galvanising-line than it can be\nwith other methods.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n155\nThis is a controlled document.

The coating weight for products intended for painting is\n275g/m, and it is designated Z275.\nSince the advent of ZM coatings, minimised spangle zinc coated products, typically used for painting, are now\ndesignated with the \"M\" after the weight, e.g., Z275M.\nThe process of zinc coating by electro-plating gives a much thinner protective film and is not considered suitable\nfor painted or unpainted cladding materials exposed to the weather.\n4.16.1.3 \nZA Coatings \nZA coatings are a zinc-aluminium alloy coating consisting of 95 % zinc and 5% aluminium by mass, with the\naddition of lanthanides. It is commonly known as Galfan and is as designated ZA in AS/NZS 1397. As an\nEuropean product it generally conforms to EN 10214..\nZA serves the same purpose as galvanised Z and AZ coatings, but has different corrosion characteristics than\nboth.\nZA coatings are not currently available in NZ or Australia.\n4.16.1.4 \nZM Coatings \nZM coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of zinc and a small amount of magnesium. Steel\nwith a continuously hot-dipped coating of zinc with 5 -13% aluminium and 2 - 4% magnesium is designated in AS\n1397:2011 as ZM. In New Zealand, it is commonly marketed as ZAM.\nThe coating weights are similar to Zinc coatings, with ZM 240 used for products which will later be coil coated\nand ZM 450 for unpainted products.\nUnpainted ZM products have been used for roofing accessory and rainwater cladding applications in New\nZealand, but are more commonly found in factory pre-painted products.\n4.16.1.5 \nAZ Coatings \nAZ coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of aluminium. AZ coating, marketed as\nZincalume steel, is an alloy of zinc and aluminium which is now the most commonly used coating in New\nZealand for protecting steel roof and wall cladding.\nAZ coating is applied in the same way as other coatings, but with a pot temperature at about 140C higher than\ngalvanised coating, and it is rapidly cooled to provide a dual-phase microstructure.\nThe alloy consists of 50 to 60% aluminium, zinc, and a small addition of silicon. In New Zealand, the ratio is\nnominally 55:45. These percentage ratios are by mass; by volume, the percentage ratio changes to approximately\n80% aluminium and 20% zinc. Volume is probably a more realistic measure of its nature.\nThe alloy coating thickness generally used for steel roof and wall cladding is 150 g/m (AZ150). This coating is\napproximately the same thickness (0.04 mm) as Z275 zinc. AZ200 coatings are available as a substrate for\norganic coated products to be used in very severe environments.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n156\nThis is a controlled document.

This finish\nhas a relatively high level of initial reflectivity, which darkens over time.\nA thin acrylic film is applied during manufacture in New Zealand. The acrylic film acts as a roll forming lubricant\nand minimises finger marking and surface discolouration.\n4.16.1.6 \nAM Coatings \nAdding magnesium to an aluminium dominant zinc-aluminium alloy coating improves the cut edge corrosion\nresistance to a similar level as zinc coating, but still confers the improved surface protection and slower erosion\nrate of AZ coatings.\nSteel with a continuously hot-dipped coating of 47 - 57% aluminium and zinc, with the addition of 1 - 3%\nmagnesium by mass is designated in AS 1397:2011 as AM.\n4.16.2 \nStainless Steel \nStainless steel is a durable, corrosion-resistant material used in harsh environments when a non-weathering\nfinish is desired. Chromium forms a tenacious oxide protective film on stainless steel that is transparent and\nself-healing, as it will repair itself on exposure to the atmosphere.\nStainless steels are resistant to most chemicals, but are subject to crevice and pit corrosion (see Wet Storage).\nSome light surface staining known as tea staining may appear, but it is not damaging to the product.\nMost stainless steel roof and wall cladding, flashings and panels in New Zealand are made from the 300 series of\naustenitic non-magnetic stainless steel, which contain chromium, nickel, and manganese, with 304 and 316 being\nthe most common grades.\nGrade 304 stainless steel is an alloy of 18% chromium and 8% nickel that provides high corrosion resistance and\nis known as an all-purpose alloy.\nGrade 316 stainless steel should be specified where tea staining must be avoided. It contains 16% chromium, 10%\nnickel, with 2% molybdenum added, which increases resistance to staining and corrosion.\nGrade 445 ferritic stainless steel is now available in New Zealand, which combines the corrosion resistance of\ngrade 316 with formability approaching that of carbon steel. As the work hardening of 445 is much lower than\nwith austenitic grades, it can be formed in a similar way to carbon steel and is more easily sheared.\nGrade 445 stainless steel contains 22% chromium and 1.2% molybdenum and no nickel. It has lower thermal\nexpansion than other grades, so it is less likely to distort in the heat of the sun. The yield stress and hardness of\n445 is higher than 304 and 316, but the tensile strength and elongation properties are lower.\nT he corrosion resistance grade of 445 is similar to grade 316 in most marine and aggressive industrial\nenvironments.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n157\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common finishes\nfor roof cladding and sheet metal flashings, are those designated as 2B and 2D.\nThe 2B finish is a bright, cold-rolled finish that is highly reflective and 2D is a dull finish that is less reflective. BA\nis a bright reflective surface only suitable for decorative cladding in thicker gauges. Embossed patterns are\navailable that reduce visible distortion and minimise glare and reflection.\nStainless steel should not be cleaned with steel wool, but stainless steel wool or synthetic abrasive pads can be\nused. Cleaning should be done with care as roughening the surface may promote further stains.\nStainless steel fixings should be used with stainless steel sheet to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion. The fastener\ngrade must match the grade of the cladding.\nThere is no well-defined yield point for stainless steels. Fully annealed or standard annealed tempers are used for\nease of forming with 304 and 316 having an approximate yield strength of 290 mPa.\nAustenitic stainless steels require different forming techniques than other metals, and are known to be tougher\nand more difficult to form than carbon steel of the same thickness, e.g.,m when shearing stainless steel the\nequipment capacity should be increased between 30% - 50%. Because of the toughness of the metal, sharp\ncutting edges dull more quickly than when used with carbon steel.\nAlthough stainless steel is not much harder than mild steel, increased power is necessary to form it because of\nits high ultimate strength and its higher work hardening rate. As most forming machines are rated for the heaviest\ngauge steel this capacity should be de-rated by 40%.\nPrecautions should be taken not to contaminate the surface of the metal by inclusions from roll forming or\nfolding equipment. It can appear as rust spots on stainless steel, which is detrimental to performance. Stainless\nsteel coil and sheet can be supplied with a strippable film on both faces to avoid this contamination.\n4.16.3 \nAluminium \nThe aluminium alloys used in New Zealand for roof and wall cladding are included in the 5000 series.\nAluminium 5005 has excellent workability, weldability, and corrosion resistance.\nAluminium 5052 is a higher-strength marine-grade alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion in marine or\nindustrial environments.\nFollowing strain-hardening of aluminium alloys, tempering increases the ductility by low-temperature heating, and\ntheir description regarding hardness relates to the last number, e.g. H12 or H32.\nThe description of tempers given to aluminium alloys can be confusing because the different alloys are strain-\nhardened in different ways. As a result, different alloys with the same hardness description may have significantly\ndifferent yield strengths.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BA01 Required Temper for Aluminium Roof and Wall Cladding.\nExtract:\n\"...Using material of a different grade or hardness may severely affect the performance of\nthe cladding profile.

Zinc roof panels and flashings are\ncommonly 0.7 mm thick, although heavier gauges can be used. Zinc roofs are usually fully supported on sarking.\nThe staining potential of zinc run-off onto other surfaces is less than that of copper and lead. Flat zinc panels\nmust be adequately vented from underneath and are available with a high-build lacquer coating to help prevent\ncorrosion of the under-surface.\nZinc has approximately twice the thermal expansion coefficient as steel, so allowance for expansion must be\nmade accordingly.\nUnder 7 deg C the metal becomes brittle and is difficult to form without fracturing.\nZinc used for roof cladding generally contains small percentages of titanium and copper, which add to the\nproperties of pure zinc.\nZinc is also available in a range of pre-patinated surfaces.\n4.16.5 \n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n159\nThis is a controlled document.

Grade 122 is the most commonly used; it has been\ndeoxidized with phosphorus, which makes it weldable. The other grades cannot be welded but can be soldered.\nCopper darkens in reaction to the atmosphere. Near seawater or industrial sources of sulphur-containing gases, a\ngreen patina may develop in time. In different environments, the weathered colour may vary from dark brown to\nalmost black.\nCopper-containing alloys, such as brass and bronze, are available when different colours are requested or for\naccessories requiring greater strength.\nCopper is more malleable than steel sheets, and annealed copper is used for hand folding or where a high degree\nof formability is required. Roll formed roofing, wall cladding, gutters, spouts, and flashings are typically made\nfrom half hard copper. Copper roofs are normally fully supported on sarking.\nCopper must be protected from contamination when being processed with tools that have been used to process\nother metals because the resulting inclusions might cause pit corrosion.\nNeither copper nor run-off from copper should come in contact with less noble metals, as it will cause galvanic\ncorrosion. Avoid installing copper in contact with or receiving run-off from bituminous material or other acidic\nsurfaces, because it prevents the formation of the protective patina, causing discolouration and a shortened\nlifespan.\n4.16.6 \nLead \nHistorically, lead has been a popular choice for roof cladding and flashings, because it is naturally durable and is\neasily shaped using hand tools at ambient temperatures, without the need for softening or annealing.\nLead has an inherent lack of mechanical strength and is laid on solid sarking. It has high thermal movement and,\nover time, there is a risk of distortion and lead sheet cracking. Sheet lead is available in weights from 6 kg/m to\n40 kg/m.\nT he thinner the lead, the shorter the length should be. A maximum length of 1500 mm or less than 1.5 m\nis ideal.\nRun-off from a new lead roof can stain other metals with a white lead carbonate. Application of a proprietary\nproduct or boiled linseed oil and mineral turpentine mixture can avoid that happening.\nA factory applied cured coating that inhibits the contact between lead and oxides with water is available. The lack\nof contact reduces the potential for run-off staining other metals, and of lead entering ground water systems.\nAvoid using lead roofs to collect potable water.\n4.16.7 \nTranslucent Sheeting \nTranslucent sheeting should be manufactured from naturally durable products or have a protective surface film to\navoid ultra-violet degradation. (See Natural light for more information.)\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n160\nThis is a controlled document.

It is protected from UV\nerosion by a surface coating consisting of a gel or laminate. The composite is extruded and set over forming\nmoulds to match specific roofing profiles. \nGRP can often be used as translucent sheeting or it can be supplied with a clear, or opaque gel coat to the\nweather surface to provide a high level of corrosion resistance to aggressive atmospheres, where coated metal\nor even non-ferrous metals may not perform as required.\nExamples of use can be found in extreme environments such as wool scouring plants, fertilizer stores, tanneries,\nacid plants and smelters, abattoirs, compost plants, galvanizing plants, and buildings in harsh geothermal areas.\nWhere an entire roof is clad in GRP, (rather than individual sheets separated by metal sheets as in a typical case\nof translucent sheeting), it affects the trafficability and safety requirements. If a GRP roof is required to be\naccessible, it can be manufactured incorporating woven roving reinforcement into the resin matrix to make it\ntrafficable. Another option would be to install stainless steel safety mesh under the roof cladding, if required.\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n161\nThis is a controlled document.

With secret fixed fasteners over a\nbenign internal environment, this is easily achieved.\nThe potential for air-borne salt ingress into the cavity of a tray roof is low; the pan is flat or nearly flat, the ribs are\nnarrow and closed at the ends. The BRANZ publication, Research Now: Roof Ventilation 2, tested the durability of\nmetals inside a vented and unvented ceiling space. Even in this Extreme Marine environment, the corrosion rate\nwas low. Their conclusion was that the installation of ventilation openings to roof cavities should not have a\nnegative effect on the long-term performance of galvanised metal fixtures in these spaces. In the unvented\nspaces, the corrosion rate was even lower.\nCompatibility of materials should also be considered. Aluminium, zinc, and aluminium/zinc alloys are compatible\nin contact. While not normally considered compatible, stainless steel clips have also been proven to be durable,\nand not affect the durability performance of aluminium, zinc, aluminium/zinc alloys, or copper, in a dry internal\nenvironment.\nOver wet and corrosive internal environments, or where the underside of a roof or canopy is exposed to weather\nfrom underneath, both the durability of the clip and compatibility of the roof and cladding material must be\nassessed in accordance with the micro-environment.\nIn all cases, adequate ventilation of the roof or wall is essential to prevent degradation of the cladding and other\nbuilding elements.\n4.17A Allowable Clip Material for Tray and Trough Cladding Over Dry Internal\nEnvironments\nRoof Galvanised,\nZincalume\nPre-painted Steel\nPre-painted aluminium\nZinc\nCopper\nClip Galvanised,\nZincalume,\nPlastic\nGalvanised,\nZincalume,\nStainless steel,\nPlastic\nPainted galvanised,\nstainless steel,\nplastic\nStainless steel,\nPlastic\nstainless steel,\nPlastic\n 4.17 TRAY ROOFING CLIP DURABILITY\n 17 \n 4.17 \n162\nThis is a controlled document.

In pre-painted steel coil this is applied continuously as a two-part primer/topcoat system, prior to the\nmaterial being roll formed into profile.\nThe different combinations of metallic coating/primer/topcoat all have different characteristics and must be\nmatched to the material and the environment in which they are to be exposed.\nThe primer and the topcoat have different performance requirements to fulfil.\n4.18.1.1 \nThe Paintline Process \n4.18.1.1A The Paintline Process\n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n163\nThis is a controlled document.

Primers used on coated steel coil have anti-corrosive pigments which inhibits corrosion through an\nelectro-chemical reaction.\n4.18.1.3 \nTop Coat and Backer \nThis is the outer skin and it must give the desired appearance. In terms of durability, it provides a measure of\nbarrier coating while still being breathable, and prevents UV degradation of the primer.\nFunctionally the top coat must be hard enough to prevent excessive marring during profiling and installation; and\nwhen in use, it must:\nbe flexible enough to form to relatively tight bends without excessive micro-cracking;\nbe resistant to fade in NZ's harsh environment;\nwithstand extremes of temperature; and\nbe a suitable surface for the collection of potable water.\nMore recent innovations include solar reflectance technology to minimise the amount of solar heat gain gathered\nby the cladding\nBacker coats generally have the same primer and a thinner top coat than the upper surface. Double-sided systems\ncan be specified for areas where the underside is seen, but in external environments these will be exposed to salt\nspray and other contaminants, and it cannot be assumed that the underside will last as long as the rain washed\ntop surface - even with regular maintenance.\nAs paint formulations from different suppliers may have different performance characteristics, it is important that\ncladding and accessories are supplied from the same manufacturer as differing weathering characteristics may\nresult in visible variance in appearance.\nSurface coating must comply with AS/NZS 2728. Cladding and flashings must come from the same source and\nhave the same coating specification, so that fade rates are similar. Fade rates must not exceed those stipulated\nin AS/NZS 2728. All coatings must be lead free and suitable for the collection of drinking water.\nAS/NZS 2728 has been deemed ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as allowing accelerated testing to\ndetermine colour fastness and durability. Such tests have been found to be an unreliable indication of a system's\nperformance in real-life situations. MRM has therefore adopted an interpretation of this standard as the\ncompliance standard for its members. In the MRM standard, the four-year real-life testing for durability and colour\nfastness are clarified as being Normative (Compulsory).\n4.18.2 \nPost-Painted Factory Applied finish \nThis coating system is most commonly used for pressed metal tiles.\nWhere a coating is applied to a Metallic coated steel or Aluminium substrate after the profile of the roofing sheet\nhas been formed is referred to as a Post-Painted Factory Applied Finish. The metallic substrate may have a coil-\ncoated primer, coil-coated anti-fingerprint coating, a factory-applied post-painted primer or be cleaned and treated\n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n164\nThis is a controlled document.

The dry film builds are high compared to pre-\nprimed or coil-coated products and the films seal any micro-cracking of the metallic coating that may have\noccurred in the forming process.\nThe corrosion performance of the post-painted factory-applied finished products is influenced by the substrate.\nThe use of Aluminium Zinc metallic coating (AZ) has been proven to work extremely well with post-painted\nfinishes in almost all environments.\nThe coatings are durable with expected first-time recoating maintenance of over 15 years. Touch-up of these\ncoatings is possible as the same coating formulation can be applied in the field. As with any organic coating,\nthere will be a gradual breakdown of the resin systems which may result in chalking of the surface.\nChalking is the result of erosion of the surface coating and slight colour changes may occur as the surface resin\nis eroded. The extent of change depends on the pigments used and also the gloss level, a coating that started as\na matt finish will change very little while a gloss finish will appear to have changed more.\nGranule-textured finishes are created using crushed rock, comprising either natural rock or natural rock coated\nwith a ceramic finish containing light-fast inorganic pigments. Both the natural rock and ceramic-coated granules\nprovide exceptional long-term colour durability. The coatings used to adhere the granules to the substrate are\ndesigned to be flexible in all environments and, although durable, the coating is protected from UV by the UV\nopaque granules.\nA clear coating is applied to the granules during the coating process, which helps bond the granules into the\nadhesive base coating and provides a robust surface reducing any damage during the transportation and\ninstallation process. As this clear coat weathers, it exposes the natural or coated surface of the granules, which\nis slightly duller than the initial finish.\n4.18.3 \nPowder Coating \nPowder coating is generally used to colour match accessories used with pre-painted steel cladding and rainwater\ngoods. The use of powder coating on metallic coated steel roof and wall cladding and flashings is not\nrecommended for the following reasons.\nIt will fade at a noticeably different rate to adjacent pre-painted metal surfaces.\nPowder coated products are length limited by the size of the curing oven and cannot be re-formed after\ncoating.\nDrilling or cutting of the sheet after powder coating will create an exposed edge vulnerable to under-cut\ncorrosion.\nStandard powder coating does not have the corrosion resistance of pre-painted metal and is vulnerable to post\ncoating damage and edge creep corrosion.\nIt is difficult to obtain adhesion to powder coated surfaces when overpainting, and the remaining powder coat\nsurface may not provide a good substrate for such.\nPower coating may be used to colour match accessories but cannot be relied upon to increase durability, unless\nspecific pre-treatment and powder coating systems are specified and applied.\n4.18.4 \n 4.18 ORGANIC COATING\n 18 \n 4.18 \n165\nThis is a controlled document.

All exposed fasteners must have a minimum durability of Class 4. (See\n17 Testing and MRM Standards)\nOnly aluminium or stainless steel screws and washers should be used on pre-painted aluminium roof and wall\ncladding. Stainless steel fasteners must not be allowed to come into contact with the cladding and should be\ninstalled through oversize holes.\nSealing washers must be non-conductive to prevent electrical contact between the screw, the metal washer and\nthe cladding surface.\nSteel cladding screws can be subject to hydrogen embrittlement when they are hot dipped galvanised. Alternative\nmethods of galvanising, such as peen plating and other metallic coatings, are generally used in combination with\nan organic coating.\nCare should be taken to minimise damage to the head of the nail or screw when using colour matched painted\nhot-dipped galvanised nails, bolts and screws.\nSandblasting in exposed conditions can significantly reduce the coating thickness and the longevity of the\nfastener.\nPremature failure can result when the shanks of the screws and the eaves purlin are exposed to sea spray, and a\nhigh-fronted gutter is recommended to help prevent this.\nThe performance of the shank of the fastener is also affected by internal environments when the contaminant is\ninside the building, e.g., animal shelters, fertiliser works.\n All fasteners should be easily identified by a code stamped on the head to identify the manufacturer and the\ncoating class.\n4.19.2 \nScrew Guns \nTo avoid damage to the coating to the screw-head, drivers should not be of the impact type and should be fitted\nwith a snug fitting driver bit.\n4.19.3 \nSealant \nSealant should be neutral cure silicone or MS polymer.\n4.19.4 \nUnderlay \n 4.19 ACCESSORIES\n 4.19 \n167\nThis is a controlled document.

These alternatives\nshould be used when underlay support is required with aluminium cladding. Ensure that the underlay-support\nfasteners do not come in contact with the underside of the cladding.\nFor buildings with harsh internal environments, stainless steel, or PVC-coated mesh and netting are available. \nPVC-coated mesh may suffer degradation from UV radiation if used externally or when it is exposed to high levels\nof direct or reflected sunlight.\n 4.19 ACCESSORIES\n 4.19 \n168\nThis is a controlled document.

The COP recommends the\nhigher figure as good trade practice and in many cases, lower life-cycle costing.\nGenerally, higher durability than the minimum requirements can be achieved by using materials and methods\noutlined in this COP, with no maintenance of coatings other than washing areas which are not naturally washed by\nrain. Elements more difficult to replace, or to access for maintenance, should be constructed of more durable\nmaterial.\nNormal Maintenance means work recognised as being necessary to achieve the expected durability of a given\nbuilding element.\nAccording to B2/AS1, normal maintenance may include:\nWashing down surfaces subject to wind-driven salt spray and contaminants.\nRe-coating protective surfaces.\nReplacing sealant seals and gaskets in joints.\nAlthough roof or wall cladding can be easily accessed and therefore easily replaced, the same cannot be\nassumed for flashings. Flashings might be embedded in plaster or behind other building elements, making them\nhard to replace without removing cladding or other building features such as windows.\nCladding material may be described as hidden, sheltered or exposed. Some flashings may have sections falling\ninto all these categories, in which case the worst case (sheltered) should prevail in material selection.\nAll metal roof and wall cladding and accessories must be designed and installed to comply with the\ndurability requirements of the NZBC.

The red rusting of iron and\nsteel is a visible example of corrosion and other examples include the weathering of copper and the\noxidation of aluminium and zinc.\nCorrosion can only happen in the presence of an electrolyte, e.g., water. The occurrence of salt (or other\ncontaminants) in the water increases the conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore greatly increases\nthe reaction rate.\nSalt contamination will also affect the time of wetness. On a clean surface, water vapour will condense\nat 100% relative humidity; on a salt-covered surface, a wet film can be formed at a relative humidity\nlevel of 75% or more.\nCorrosion can also be the result of direct contact with another metal or substance, the result of run-off\nfrom incompatible surfaces or the fall-out of corrosive particles. Time of wetness, presence or lack of\noxygen, and atmospheric contaminants greatly affect the rate of corrosion.\nDifferences in electrical potential on the surface of corroding metal create microscopic cells comprising\ncathodes and anodes. In the case of iron, the positively charged electrons in the anode react with the\nnegatively charged hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte to form iron oxide on the anode. Similar reactions\noccur with other metals. Polarisation changes on the surface cause anodic areas to become cathodic and\nvice versa, so over time, the rate of corrosion is relatively uniform over the surface.\nThe build-up of debris on a cladding surface will promote corrosion. The salts in the debris react with the\ncladding each time they are wetted, and the deposits themselves impede surface drying, increasing the\ntime of wetness.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 2 \n 4.2 \n102\nThis is a controlled document.

Salt deposits have been\nmeasured as far inland as Lake Taupo in the North Island. Geographic or man-made obstructions, such as trees\nor buildings, slow air velocity and allow the air to discharge some of its salt burden, which can make the\nenvironment less aggressive. Conversely, where there are few impediments to the free flow of air, severe marine\ninfluence can extend well inland.\nIn high humidity levels, or when wetted by condensation, marine salts absorb water and form a chloride solution.\nTherefore, the effect of salt spray is greatest in unwashed areas, where salts can accumulate over time.\nWhere the ends of roof cladding are exposed to contaminants such as sea salt or industrial pollutants, it is good\npractice to provide an over-flashing which discharges into the gutter or spouting. (See 8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves\nFlashing Option 1.)\nIt gives a measure of protection to the underside of the roof cladding and the underlay.\nIt provides support for the roofing underlay which is subject to damage from wind and UV.\nWhen using PVC spouting, there is a gap between the spouting and the fascia caused by the thickness of the\nbrackets. In coastal locations where the ends of roof cladding are exposed, this unwashed area becomes\nsusceptible to corrosion. A gutter apron can minimise this risk.\nIf there is no spouting or it has a low front.\nIn severe environments, wind can drive contaminants up the ribs of exposed ends of roof cladding. Metal\nscriber flashings or filler blocks can be used to prevent or inhibit ventilation.\nThe over-flashing should extend 50 mm into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the\nflashing. If there is no over-flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a minimum of\n20 mm.\nIn some cases, the over-flashing becomes a sacrificial flashing which can extend the life of the cladding. In such\ncircumstances, the COP recommends making the flashing from aluminium.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 5 \n 4.5 \n107\nThis is a controlled document.

They should\ndesign their building and select materials considering a combination of all these factors.\n4.5.2 \nSea Spray \nThe major contributor to metal corrosion in New Zealand is sea spray. Seaspray contains a mixture of salts\nconsisting of 2.5 to 4% sodium chloride and small quantities of magnesium, calcium and potassium chloride.\nThese salts make water far more electrically conductive and, therefore, will cause more corrosion.\nSeaspray, evaporation, and infrequent rain increase salt concentrations on exterior surfaces, particularly when it\naccumulates in unwashed areas.\n2\n2\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n106\nThis is a controlled document.

Salt deposits have been\nmeasured as far inland as Lake Taupo in the North Island. Geographic or man-made obstructions, such as trees\nor buildings, slow air velocity and allow the air to discharge some of its salt burden, which can make the\nenvironment less aggressive. Conversely, where there are few impediments to the free flow of air, severe marine\ninfluence can extend well inland.\nIn high humidity levels, or when wetted by condensation, marine salts absorb water and form a chloride solution.\nTherefore, the effect of salt spray is greatest in unwashed areas, where salts can accumulate over time.\nWhere the ends of roof cladding are exposed to contaminants such as sea salt or industrial pollutants, it is good\npractice to provide an over-flashing which discharges into the gutter or spouting. (See 8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves\nFlashing Option 1.)\nIt gives a measure of protection to the underside of the roof cladding and the underlay.\nIt provides support for the roofing underlay which is subject to damage from wind and UV.\nWhen using PVC spouting, there is a gap between the spouting and the fascia caused by the thickness of the\nbrackets. In coastal locations where the ends of roof cladding are exposed, this unwashed area becomes\nsusceptible to corrosion. A gutter apron can minimise this risk.\nIf there is no spouting or it has a low front.\nIn severe environments, wind can drive contaminants up the ribs of exposed ends of roof cladding. Metal\nscriber flashings or filler blocks can be used to prevent or inhibit ventilation.\nThe over-flashing should extend 50 mm into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the\nflashing. If there is no over-flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a minimum of\n20 mm.\nIn some cases, the over-flashing becomes a sacrificial flashing which can extend the life of the cladding. In such\ncircumstances, the COP recommends making the flashing from aluminium.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.5 THE ENVIRONMENT\n 5 \n 4.5 \n107\nThis is a controlled document.

The designer should choose the appropriate materials for the location.\nThe chosen materials should meet the minimum durability requirements of the NZBC and satisfy\ncustomer expectations.\n4.6.1 \nAssessment of Marine Environments \nWind is responsible for the salinity present in marine atmospheres. The wind picks up particles of salt\nfrom breaking waves and can carry them inland. The quantity of salt aerosol entrained by the wind is\naffected by many factors, such as wind strength, wave height, the width of the generation zone, and the\ncontours of the seabed and coastline. These factors along with the persistence of the wind from a given\nquarter determine the corrosivity of a shoreline.\nWhile salt deposits are measurably present in inland areas such as Taupo, the main effect of marine\natmospheres reaches just a few hundred metres from the shore. Particles of salt in the air deposit on\nadjacent surfaces through gravity and contact; the rate at which deposits settle is affected by the\nroughness of the ground that the salt-laden air passes over. Obstacles such as trees slow the wind down,\nincreasing the rate of gravitational deposit, and bringing the salt aerosol in more contact with surfaces\non which they can deposit.\nOn the other hand, open flat land and natural \"wind tunnels\" can allow quite high concentrations of salt\nto travel several hundred metres inland.\nA site's location, relative to the sea or marine inlets, is a common method used to assess the corrosivity\nof a location. The distance from salt water for a given Zone varies with the location, depending on the\nprevailing winds and roughness of water in those areas, as well as the evenness of the terrain it passes\nover.\nWhere environmental Zones overlap, a site-specific evaluation may help define the category into which\nit best fits. Visual evidence of corrosion on adjacent metal surfaces may be present, ground roughness\ncan be assessed, industrial influences can be evaluated and data about the persistence of onshore\nwinds can be obtained from NIWA.\nMore local factors that affect the corrosivity of a specific location include:\nOverhanging shade increases the time of wetness of a structure and corrosion rate.\nHigh levels of water roughness such as caused by strong tidal flow against the wind direction, as is\noften experienced in areas such as Cook Strait, increases salt spray.\nSurfaces not receiving regular and effective rain washing or sufficient manual washing may\nexperience corrosion rates two to three times that of cleaned surfaces.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 6 \n 4.6 \n108\nThis is a controlled document.

Under certain conditions, some metals react with the environment or\nchemicals to form a passive surface, which renders them less active, so that any ranking can be misleading.\n\"Passivity\" becomes an important phenomenon in controlling corrosion rates.\nHowever, the Electrochemical series table is still a useful indicator of electrode potential. The further apart two\nmetals are in the electrochemical series, the greater the potential difference between them.\nMetals termed anodic, active, negative, or less noble corrode in preference to metals that are deemed more\ncathodic, noble, positive or less active. The less noble metal becomes the anode and is subject to corrosion. The\ngreater the potential difference, the more corrosion there will be of the less noble metal; i.e., on the anode.\nThe difference in nobility is why zinc can protect a steel substrate.\nDifferent electrolytes can lead to different rankings, and metal alloys may display more than one potential than\nthat which applies to their \"active\" state.\nThe exposed surface ratio of anode and cathode determines the rate of dissimilar metal corrosion. For instance,\nif a fastener which has a small surface compared to the cladding becomes the anode, its current density will be\nhigh, and the fastener will corrode quickly; e.g., an aluminium rivet in a copper sheet.

When\ncondensation, dew or humidity moistens these particles, they react with metal cladding. The reaction is often\nnoticeable as a white zinc corrosion effect, which will precede more serious corrosion.\nAn unwashed or sheltered area is any surface that is above or inside a line drawn at 45 deg to any weathertight\noverhang. Such areas require special consideration, particularly in severe environments.\nUnwashed areas include: unlined soffits, roof overhangs, canopies, sheltered walls, and the upper part of garage\ndoors.\nWall claddings receive less effective rain washing than roofs, and may be harder to maintain or replace, so\nmaterials for wall cladding should be selected accordingly.\n4.10.1A Unwashed Soffits\nUnwashed soffits \ncomprising areas of main \nroof are best avoided\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n128\nThis is a controlled document.

The copper pipes of solar panels, air-conditioning or other ancillary\nequipment must be sealed to avoid runoff onto any metal cladding or gutters other than copper.\n4.10.5 \nWalkways \nOnly aluminium, stainless steel, inert plastic, or hot-dipped galvanized steel framing members are\nacceptable for support structures above steel cladding and must be supported by the structural\nmembers or across the ribs of the profile adjacent to the ribs. They should be designed to allow natural\nrain washing of the roof underneath.\n4.10.6 \nCapillary Action \nWhile capillary action is both a durability and a weather-tightness issue, it is considered here because it affects\ndurability more often than water tightness, although the two are interrelated.\nCapillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow into narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition\nto, external forces such as gravity. It is caused by the combination of intermolecular forces of surface tension in\nthe water and adhesive forces between the liquid and surrounding surfaces.\nCapillary action can be seen when liquid is drawn up between the bristles of a paintbrush, in absorbent materials\nsuch as blotting paper or a sponge, in a burning candle, a fountain pen, or in the cells of a tree. The effect can\noccur in a tube, but also between two closely spaced mating surfaces.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n133\nThis is a controlled document.

Closely stacked sheets of trapezoidal or corrugate profiles, or flat sheet that has the sheet ends\nexposed to rain, will draw water between the surfaces which can infiltrate a long way into the stack of\nmaterial. After a short time in the absence of air, it can form volatile corrosive products which are\nunsightly and detrimental to product life.\nWhile metallic coatings have temporary surface protection against wet storage stain and organic\ncoatings also give some protection, there is no hard and fast rule as to how long this will last; it is up\nto the roofing contractor to take appropriate measures. Packs of close stacked sheets exposed to\nwater must be fillet or cross stacked to allow natural air movement and drying, before the onset of\nwet storage stain.\n2. Capillary action can take place in the side lap of roofing sheets, or between a longitudinal flashing and\nthe adjacent rib. For this reason, side laps should be designed with a capillary break, and when\ncalculating the water carrying capacity of a profile, the allowable water depth is taken as being to the\nbottom of the capillary bead, not the rib height. \nEven corrugate profiles are designed to have an asymmetrical shape between under and over crest.\nHowever, this is not normally as effective as the capillary break on a rib profile. This is one of the\nreasons why the minimum pitch for standard corrugate is 8 deg , although it has been proven to perform\nat lower pitches in short runs if the dimension of the overlap is not too generous and it is not\nextending into the water table.\nWith longitudinal flashings, such as barges, the downturn into the pan should not be tight against the\nrib, but have a gap to avoid capillary action from occurring.\n3. Capillary action is also common between the end laps of sheets. When short-run sheets were the\nnorm and end laps were common, the onset of corrosion normally occurred around the lap, despite\nprimer being applied to the surfaces. It was most often concentrated on the upper end of the lap and\nwas caused not by rainwater but by condensation on the underside of the sheet entering the lap.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n134\nThis is a controlled document.

End laps on roofing should be avoided where possible. Where they do occur, end laps must be sealed\nat both ends to avoid ingress of moisture from both internal condensation and external rainfall, and\nend laps in vertical sheets must be sealed at the top end of the lap.\n4.10.6B Roofing Sheet End Lap\nSilicon sealant or lap \ntape at both ends of \nthe lap\n5. The adhesive nature of water that causes capillary action can help drive water up the underside of\nthe sheets at the eaves, rather than discharging into the gutter. Therefore, the ends of all sheets laid\nto a fall less than 8 deg require a drip edge; and the minimum roof pitch of standard corrugate is 8 deg , as it\nis difficult to form a drip edge in that profile.The lower edge of all roofing sheets and flashings laid to a\nfall of less than 8 deg must be drip formed into the gutter to prevent capillary action. \n4.10.7 \nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain \nRoofing materials exposed to the air react with the atmosphere to form a relatively stable surface. Exposing\nmetals to water in the absence air causes the formation of unstable surface films.\nCrevice corrosion occurs in crevices and confined spaces. Crevices are often created because of overlapping\nflashing or sheets of cladding, or between the sheets of close stacked materials.\nDesign details that trap moisture, dirt, and debris should be avoided.\nCorrosion can appear even with a chemically neutral electrolyte. An example of this type of corrosion is the\ncorrosion on metals underneath paint coatings and \"white rust\" - the wet storage stain on closely nested zinc\ncoated roofing sheets. Other metals, such as aluminium/zinc coated and non-ferrous metals, can suffer similar\ndamage.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n135\nThis is a controlled document.

On metallic-coated steel sheets, the passivation\ncoating gives some temporary protection against this process, as do organic coatings, but longevity cannot be\nguaranteed for the duration of this protection. On non-ferrous, metals, wet storage stain can commence very\nrapidly.\nWet packs of sheets should be separated to allow surfaces to dry before substantial storage.\nIf wet storage stain appears on unpainted surfaces, the degree of erosion of the metallic surface may be slight\ndespite the bulky appearance of the deposits. However, when left unchecked it, can quite quickly lead to\nsubstantial degradation. If required, measurements can be taken of the thickness of the material or the metallic\ncoating to determine the extent of erosion.\nEven if the damage is superficial, the white deposits must be removed to allow exposure to the air to allow the\nnormal formation of stable surface films. Use a stiff bristle brush; wire brushes are not recommended as they\nwill remove more of the protective coating.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n137\nThis is a controlled document.

They may\nachieve this objective, but instead they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the eaves line of\nthe roof.\nThat can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly increased time of wetness, and\nprevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\nThe COP recommends against the installation of such products. Alternative solutions include fitting a durable\nspouting material such as copper, installing rain heads with a leaf trap, or installing a proprietary leaf-proof\nspouting system.\nA printable bulletin concerning proprietary leaf guards is available\nat: BGLG01 Using Propietary Leaf Guards.\nExtract:\n\"Leaf guards are widely marketed as a way to prevent the build-up of vegetable matter in spouting.\nThey may achieve this objective, but they often result in a build-up of a plant material poultice on the\neaves line of the roof which can cause premature corrosion of the roof by chemical reaction, greatly\nincreased time of wetness, and prevention of adequate ventilation of the underside of the cladding.\"\n 4 DURABILITY\n 10 \n 4.10 \n139\nThis is a controlled document.

Closely stacked sheets of trapezoidal or corrugate profiles, or flat sheet that has the sheet ends\nexposed to rain, will draw water between the surfaces which can infiltrate a long way into the stack of\nmaterial. After a short time in the absence of air, it can form volatile corrosive products which are\nunsightly and detrimental to product life.\nWhile metallic coatings have temporary surface protection against wet storage stain and organic\ncoatings also give some protection, there is no hard and fast rule as to how long this will last; it is up\nto the roofing contractor to take appropriate measures. Packs of close stacked sheets exposed to\nwater must be fillet or cross stacked to allow natural air movement and drying, before the onset of\nwet storage stain.\n2. Capillary action can take place in the side lap of roofing sheets, or between a longitudinal flashing and\nthe adjacent rib. For this reason, side laps should be designed with a capillary break, and when\ncalculating the water carrying capacity of a profile, the allowable water depth is taken as being to the\nbottom of the capillary bead, not the rib height. \nEven corrugate profiles are designed to have an asymmetrical shape between under and over crest.\nHowever, this is not normally as effective as the capillary break on a rib profile. This is one of the\nreasons why the minimum pitch for standard corrugate is 8 deg , although it has been proven to perform\nat lower pitches in short runs if the dimension of the overlap is not too generous and it is not\nextending into the water table.\nWith longitudinal flashings, such as barges, the downturn into the pan should not be tight against the\nrib, but have a gap to avoid capillary action from occurring.\n3. Capillary action is also common between the end laps of sheets. When short-run sheets were the\nnorm and end laps were common, the onset of corrosion normally occurred around the lap, despite\nprimer being applied to the surfaces. It was most often concentrated on the upper end of the lap and\nwas caused not by rainwater but by condensation on the underside of the sheet entering the lap.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n134\nThis is a controlled document.

The adhesive nature of water that causes capillary action can help drive water up the underside of\nthe sheets at the eaves, rather than discharging into the gutter. Therefore, the ends of all sheets laid\nto a fall less than 8 deg require a drip edge; and the minimum roof pitch of standard corrugate is 8 deg , as it\nis difficult to form a drip edge in that profile.The lower edge of all roofing sheets and flashings laid to a\nfall of less than 8 deg must be drip formed into the gutter to prevent capillary action. \n4.10.7 \nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain \nRoofing materials exposed to the air react with the atmosphere to form a relatively stable surface. Exposing\nmetals to water in the absence air causes the formation of unstable surface films.\nCrevice corrosion occurs in crevices and confined spaces. Crevices are often created because of overlapping\nflashing or sheets of cladding, or between the sheets of close stacked materials.\nDesign details that trap moisture, dirt, and debris should be avoided.\nCorrosion can appear even with a chemically neutral electrolyte. An example of this type of corrosion is the\ncorrosion on metals underneath paint coatings and \"white rust\" - the wet storage stain on closely nested zinc\ncoated roofing sheets. Other metals, such as aluminium/zinc coated and non-ferrous metals, can suffer similar\ndamage.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n135\nThis is a controlled document.

Therefore, the ends of all sheets laid\nto a fall less than 8 deg require a drip edge; and the minimum roof pitch of standard corrugate is 8 deg , as it\nis difficult to form a drip edge in that profile.The lower edge of all roofing sheets and flashings laid to a\nfall of less than 8 deg must be drip formed into the gutter to prevent capillary action. \n4.10.7 \nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain \nRoofing materials exposed to the air react with the atmosphere to form a relatively stable surface. Exposing\nmetals to water in the absence air causes the formation of unstable surface films.\nCrevice corrosion occurs in crevices and confined spaces. Crevices are often created because of overlapping\nflashing or sheets of cladding, or between the sheets of close stacked materials.\nDesign details that trap moisture, dirt, and debris should be avoided.\nCorrosion can appear even with a chemically neutral electrolyte. An example of this type of corrosion is the\ncorrosion on metals underneath paint coatings and \"white rust\" - the wet storage stain on closely nested zinc\ncoated roofing sheets. Other metals, such as aluminium/zinc coated and non-ferrous metals, can suffer similar\ndamage.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.10 OTHER CAUSES OF CORROSION\n 10 \n 4.10 \n135\nThis is a controlled document.

On metallic-coated steel sheets, the passivation\ncoating gives some temporary protection against this process, as do organic coatings, but longevity cannot be\nguaranteed for the duration of this protection. On non-ferrous, metals, wet storage stain can commence very\nrapidly.\nWet packs of sheets should be separated to allow surfaces to dry before substantial storage.\nIf wet storage stain appears on unpainted surfaces, the degree of erosion of the metallic surface may be slight\ndespite the bulky appearance of the deposits. However, when left unchecked it, can quite quickly lead to\nsubstantial degradation. If required, measurements can be taken of the thickness of the material or the metallic\ncoating to determine the extent of erosion.\nEven if the damage is superficial, the white deposits must be removed to allow exposure to the air to allow the\nnormal formation of stable surface films.

These stains\nare often mistaken for early deterioration of the cladding.\nTo some degree, swarf will normally be evident at the completion of any roof cladding job. The acceptability of\nswarf depends on how it got there, whether techniques have been applied to minimize it, and the visual exposure\nof the cladding.\nSwarf created by acceptable means of cutting - i.e., power drills, self-drilling screws and shears - will be either\nloose or lightly adhered to the surface film of painted or unpainted sheets. Most swarf can be removed by daily\nhosing, sweeping, or blowing which should be done at the end of each day and at the completion of the job. \nAvoid blowing loose swarf under adjacent cover flashings.\nAny remaining swarf will not be in contact with the metallic substrate and will not cause deterioration of the roof,\nits effect is aesthetic only.

It works by the zinc\nsacrificing preferentially to the steel.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, research looked for metallic coatings which would provide longer life.\nAluminium was tried as a coating material because of its passive surface, but it was not satisfactory on its own.\nHowever, aluminium alloyed with zinc and other metals produced more corrosion-proof products than any metal\non its own. (See 4.4.2 Barrier Protection.)\nWe now have two groups of metallic coatings for steel cladding products - zinc-dominant coatings, which\nprimarily provide sacrificial protection; and aluminium-dominant coatings, which primarily provide a barrier\nprotective coating of aluminium oxide. Coatings containing both aluminium and zinc are now the preferred\ncoating for roof and wall cladding products, although zinc-based coatings continue to predominate for various\nother products.\nThe composition and weights of these coatings are described in detail in AS 1397:2011. The following sections\ndiscuss metallic coatings in the order in which they appear in AS 1397, not their rate of use in the market.\n4.16.1.1.1 \nCoating Thickness \nSteel was zinc-coated for many years by dipping short lengths of flat or profiled sheet metal in a bath of molten\nzinc, and the steel was then hung to cool while the excess zinc coating drained off.\nMore than sixty years ago manufacturers developed a continuous hot dipping method. During the continuous hot\ndipping process, the steel coil is run through a bath of molten metal. The thickness is controlled by blowing off\nthe excess coating with air jets applied to both sides of the strip as it leaves the molten metal bath. \nContinuous hot dipping, as opposed to the batch immersion process, is more cost-effective and allows for\ngreater control of the consistency, thickness, and surface condition of the metallic coating.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n154\nThis is a controlled document.

The coating thickness of sheet and strip\nrefers to the collective amount of coating on both sides of the sheet, effectively dividing the coating weight by\nhalf. It is invalid to equate the coating weight in g/m of hot-dipped zinc coatings on fabricated products, such as\nnails and screws, with that of metallic coatings on sheet and coil; the coating thickness of the fabricated\nproducts relates to one surface only.\nA micron (m) is one-thousandth of a millimetre.\n4.16.1.2 \nGalvanised Steel \nZinc Coating, commonly called galvanising, is still one of the most common metallic coating processes for steel.\nGalvanising describes various methods of adding a metallic zinc coating to steel to give it cathodic protection;\nalso known as galvanic protection.\nGalvanised steel is classed as a \"Z\"-coating and has a bold crystalline pattern or spangle, a random geometric\npattern that resembles frost on a window.\nThere are many processes for galvanising, but only products dipped or immersed in a bath of molten zinc can be\ncalled hot-dipped galvanised, the process used for the metallic coating of steel roof and wall cladding.\nThe thickness of the coating can be more precisely controlled on a continuous coil galvanising-line than it can be\nwith other methods.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n155\nThis is a controlled document.

The coating weight for products intended for painting is\n275g/m, and it is designated Z275.\nSince the advent of ZM coatings, minimised spangle zinc coated products, typically used for painting, are now\ndesignated with the \"M\" after the weight, e.g., Z275M.\nThe process of zinc coating by electro-plating gives a much thinner protective film and is not considered suitable\nfor painted or unpainted cladding materials exposed to the weather.\n4.16.1.3 \nZA Coatings \nZA coatings are a zinc-aluminium alloy coating consisting of 95 % zinc and 5% aluminium by mass, with the\naddition of lanthanides. It is commonly known as Galfan and is as designated ZA in AS/NZS 1397. As an\nEuropean product it generally conforms to EN 10214..\nZA serves the same purpose as galvanised Z and AZ coatings, but has different corrosion characteristics than\nboth.\nZA coatings are not currently available in NZ or Australia.\n4.16.1.4 \nZM Coatings \nZM coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of zinc and a small amount of magnesium. Steel\nwith a continuously hot-dipped coating of zinc with 5 -13% aluminium and 2 - 4% magnesium is designated in AS\n1397:2011 as ZM. In New Zealand, it is commonly marketed as ZAM.\nThe coating weights are similar to Zinc coatings, with ZM 240 used for products which will later be coil coated\nand ZM 450 for unpainted products.\nUnpainted ZM products have been used for roofing accessory and rainwater cladding applications in New\nZealand, but are more commonly found in factory pre-painted products.\n4.16.1.5 \nAZ Coatings \nAZ coatings are zinc-aluminium alloy coatings with a majority of aluminium. AZ coating, marketed as\nZincalume steel, is an alloy of zinc and aluminium which is now the most commonly used coating in New\nZealand for protecting steel roof and wall cladding.\nAZ coating is applied in the same way as other coatings, but with a pot temperature at about 140C higher than\ngalvanised coating, and it is rapidly cooled to provide a dual-phase microstructure.\nThe alloy consists of 50 to 60% aluminium, zinc, and a small addition of silicon. In New Zealand, the ratio is\nnominally 55:45. These percentage ratios are by mass; by volume, the percentage ratio changes to approximately\n80% aluminium and 20% zinc. Volume is probably a more realistic measure of its nature.\nThe alloy coating thickness generally used for steel roof and wall cladding is 150 g/m (AZ150). This coating is\napproximately the same thickness (0.04 mm) as Z275 zinc. AZ200 coatings are available as a substrate for\norganic coated products to be used in very severe environments.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n156\nThis is a controlled document.

This finish\nhas a relatively high level of initial reflectivity, which darkens over time.\nA thin acrylic film is applied during manufacture in New Zealand. The acrylic film acts as a roll forming lubricant\nand minimises finger marking and surface discolouration.\n4.16.1.6 \nAM Coatings \nAdding magnesium to an aluminium dominant zinc-aluminium alloy coating improves the cut edge corrosion\nresistance to a similar level as zinc coating, but still confers the improved surface protection and slower erosion\nrate of AZ coatings.\nSteel with a continuously hot-dipped coating of 47 - 57% aluminium and zinc, with the addition of 1 - 3%\nmagnesium by mass is designated in AS 1397:2011 as AM.\n4.16.2 \nStainless Steel \nStainless steel is a durable, corrosion-resistant material used in harsh environments when a non-weathering\nfinish is desired. Chromium forms a tenacious oxide protective film on stainless steel that is transparent and\nself-healing, as it will repair itself on exposure to the atmosphere.\nStainless steels are resistant to most chemicals, but are subject to crevice and pit corrosion (see Wet Storage).\nSome light surface staining known as tea staining may appear, but it is not damaging to the product.\nMost stainless steel roof and wall cladding, flashings and panels in New Zealand are made from the 300 series of\naustenitic non-magnetic stainless steel, which contain chromium, nickel, and manganese, with 304 and 316 being\nthe most common grades.\nGrade 304 stainless steel is an alloy of 18% chromium and 8% nickel that provides high corrosion resistance and\nis known as an all-purpose alloy.\nGrade 316 stainless steel should be specified where tea staining must be avoided. It contains 16% chromium, 10%\nnickel, with 2% molybdenum added, which increases resistance to staining and corrosion.\nGrade 445 ferritic stainless steel is now available in New Zealand, which combines the corrosion resistance of\ngrade 316 with formability approaching that of carbon steel. As the work hardening of 445 is much lower than\nwith austenitic grades, it can be formed in a similar way to carbon steel and is more easily sheared.\nGrade 445 stainless steel contains 22% chromium and 1.2% molybdenum and no nickel. It has lower thermal\nexpansion than other grades, so it is less likely to distort in the heat of the sun. The yield stress and hardness of\n445 is higher than 304 and 316, but the tensile strength and elongation properties are lower.\nT he corrosion resistance grade of 445 is similar to grade 316 in most marine and aggressive industrial\nenvironments.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n157\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common finishes\nfor roof cladding and sheet metal flashings, are those designated as 2B and 2D.\nThe 2B finish is a bright, cold-rolled finish that is highly reflective and 2D is a dull finish that is less reflective. BA\nis a bright reflective surface only suitable for decorative cladding in thicker gauges. Embossed patterns are\navailable that reduce visible distortion and minimise glare and reflection.\nStainless steel should not be cleaned with steel wool, but stainless steel wool or synthetic abrasive pads can be\nused. Cleaning should be done with care as roughening the surface may promote further stains.\nStainless steel fixings should be used with stainless steel sheet to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion. The fastener\ngrade must match the grade of the cladding.\nThere is no well-defined yield point for stainless steels. Fully annealed or standard annealed tempers are used for\nease of forming with 304 and 316 having an approximate yield strength of 290 mPa.\nAustenitic stainless steels require different forming techniques than other metals, and are known to be tougher\nand more difficult to form than carbon steel of the same thickness, e.g.,m when shearing stainless steel the\nequipment capacity should be increased between 30% - 50%. Because of the toughness of the metal, sharp\ncutting edges dull more quickly than when used with carbon steel.\nAlthough stainless steel is not much harder than mild steel, increased power is necessary to form it because of\nits high ultimate strength and its higher work hardening rate. As most forming machines are rated for the heaviest\ngauge steel this capacity should be de-rated by 40%.\nPrecautions should be taken not to contaminate the surface of the metal by inclusions from roll forming or\nfolding equipment. It can appear as rust spots on stainless steel, which is detrimental to performance. Stainless\nsteel coil and sheet can be supplied with a strippable film on both faces to avoid this contamination.\n4.16.3 \nAluminium \nThe aluminium alloys used in New Zealand for roof and wall cladding are included in the 5000 series.\nAluminium 5005 has excellent workability, weldability, and corrosion resistance.\nAluminium 5052 is a higher-strength marine-grade alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion in marine or\nindustrial environments.\nFollowing strain-hardening of aluminium alloys, tempering increases the ductility by low-temperature heating, and\ntheir description regarding hardness relates to the last number, e.g. H12 or H32.\nThe description of tempers given to aluminium alloys can be confusing because the different alloys are strain-\nhardened in different ways. As a result, different alloys with the same hardness description may have significantly\ndifferent yield strengths.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BA01 Required Temper for Aluminium Roof and Wall Cladding.\nExtract:\n\"...Using material of a different grade or hardness may severely affect the performance of\nthe cladding profile.

Zinc roof panels and flashings are\ncommonly 0.7 mm thick, although heavier gauges can be used. Zinc roofs are usually fully supported on sarking.\nThe staining potential of zinc run-off onto other surfaces is less than that of copper and lead. Flat zinc panels\nmust be adequately vented from underneath and are available with a high-build lacquer coating to help prevent\ncorrosion of the under-surface.\nZinc has approximately twice the thermal expansion coefficient as steel, so allowance for expansion must be\nmade accordingly.\nUnder 7 deg C the metal becomes brittle and is difficult to form without fracturing.\nZinc used for roof cladding generally contains small percentages of titanium and copper, which add to the\nproperties of pure zinc.\nZinc is also available in a range of pre-patinated surfaces.\n4.16.5 \n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n159\nThis is a controlled document.

Grade 122 is the most commonly used; it has been\ndeoxidized with phosphorus, which makes it weldable. The other grades cannot be welded but can be soldered.\nCopper darkens in reaction to the atmosphere. Near seawater or industrial sources of sulphur-containing gases, a\ngreen patina may develop in time. In different environments, the weathered colour may vary from dark brown to\nalmost black.\nCopper-containing alloys, such as brass and bronze, are available when different colours are requested or for\naccessories requiring greater strength.\nCopper is more malleable than steel sheets, and annealed copper is used for hand folding or where a high degree\nof formability is required. Roll formed roofing, wall cladding, gutters, spouts, and flashings are typically made\nfrom half hard copper. Copper roofs are normally fully supported on sarking.\nCopper must be protected from contamination when being processed with tools that have been used to process\nother metals because the resulting inclusions might cause pit corrosion.\nNeither copper nor run-off from copper should come in contact with less noble metals, as it will cause galvanic\ncorrosion. Avoid installing copper in contact with or receiving run-off from bituminous material or other acidic\nsurfaces, because it prevents the formation of the protective patina, causing discolouration and a shortened\nlifespan.\n4.16.6 \nLead \nHistorically, lead has been a popular choice for roof cladding and flashings, because it is naturally durable and is\neasily shaped using hand tools at ambient temperatures, without the need for softening or annealing.\nLead has an inherent lack of mechanical strength and is laid on solid sarking. It has high thermal movement and,\nover time, there is a risk of distortion and lead sheet cracking. Sheet lead is available in weights from 6 kg/m to\n40 kg/m.\nT he thinner the lead, the shorter the length should be. A maximum length of 1500 mm or less than 1.5 m\nis ideal.\nRun-off from a new lead roof can stain other metals with a white lead carbonate. Application of a proprietary\nproduct or boiled linseed oil and mineral turpentine mixture can avoid that happening.\nA factory applied cured coating that inhibits the contact between lead and oxides with water is available. The lack\nof contact reduces the potential for run-off staining other metals, and of lead entering ground water systems.\nAvoid using lead roofs to collect potable water.\n4.16.7 \nTranslucent Sheeting \nTranslucent sheeting should be manufactured from naturally durable products or have a protective surface film to\navoid ultra-violet degradation.

It is protected from UV\nerosion by a surface coating consisting of a gel or laminate. The composite is extruded and set over forming\nmoulds to match specific roofing profiles. \nGRP can often be used as translucent sheeting or it can be supplied with a clear, or opaque gel coat to the\nweather surface to provide a high level of corrosion resistance to aggressive atmospheres, where coated metal\nor even non-ferrous metals may not perform as required.\nExamples of use can be found in extreme environments such as wool scouring plants, fertilizer stores, tanneries,\nacid plants and smelters, abattoirs, compost plants, galvanizing plants, and buildings in harsh geothermal areas.\nWhere an entire roof is clad in GRP, (rather than individual sheets separated by metal sheets as in a typical case\nof translucent sheeting), it affects the trafficability and safety requirements. If a GRP roof is required to be\naccessible, it can be manufactured incorporating woven roving reinforcement into the resin matrix to make it\ntrafficable. Another option would be to install stainless steel safety mesh under the roof cladding, if required.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 16 \n 4.16 \n161\nThis is a controlled document.

It works by the zinc\nsacrificing preferentially to the steel.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, research looked for metallic coatings which would provide longer life.\nAluminium was tried as a coating material because of its passive surface, but it was not satisfactory on its own.\nHowever, aluminium alloyed with zinc and other metals produced more corrosion-proof products than any metal\non its own. (See 4.4.2 Barrier Protection.)\nWe now have two groups of metallic coatings for steel cladding products - zinc-dominant coatings, which\nprimarily provide sacrificial protection; and aluminium-dominant coatings, which primarily provide a barrier\nprotective coating of aluminium oxide. Coatings containing both aluminium and zinc are now the preferred\ncoating for roof and wall cladding products, although zinc-based coatings continue to predominate for various\nother products.\nThe composition and weights of these coatings are described in detail in AS 1397:2011. The following sections\ndiscuss metallic coatings in the order in which they appear in AS 1397, not their rate of use in the market.\n4.16.1.1.1 \nCoating Thickness \nSteel was zinc-coated for many years by dipping short lengths of flat or profiled sheet metal in a bath of molten\nzinc, and the steel was then hung to cool while the excess zinc coating drained off.\nMore than sixty years ago manufacturers developed a continuous hot dipping method. During the continuous hot\ndipping process, the steel coil is run through a bath of molten metal. The thickness is controlled by blowing off\nthe excess coating with air jets applied to both sides of the strip as it leaves the molten metal bath. \nContinuous hot dipping, as opposed to the batch immersion process, is more cost-effective and allows for\ngreater control of the consistency, thickness, and surface condition of the metallic coating.\n 4 DURABILITY\n 4.16 MATERIALS\n 16 \n 4.16 \n154\nThis is a controlled document.

In terms of durability, it provides a measure of\nbarrier coating while still being breathable, and prevents UV degradation of the primer.\nFunctionally the top coat must be hard enough to prevent excessive marring during profiling and installation; and\nwhen in use, it must:\nbe flexible enough to form to relatively tight bends without excessive micro-cracking;\nbe resistant to fade in NZ's harsh environment;\nwithstand extremes of temperature; and\nbe a suitable surface for the collection of potable water.\nMore recent innovations include solar reflectance technology to minimise the amount of solar heat gain gathered\nby the cladding\nBacker coats generally have the same primer and a thinner top coat than the upper surface. Double-sided systems\ncan be specified for areas where the underside is seen, but in external environments these will be exposed to salt\nspray and other contaminants, and it cannot be assumed that the underside will last as long as the rain washed\ntop surface - even with regular maintenance.\nAs paint formulations from different suppliers may have different performance characteristics, it is important that\ncladding and accessories are supplied from the same manufacturer as differing weathering characteristics may\nresult in visible variance in appearance.\nSurface coating must comply with AS/NZS 2728. Cladding and flashings must come from the same source and\nhave the same coating specification, so that fade rates are similar. Fade rates must not exceed those stipulated\nin AS/NZS 2728. All coatings must be lead free and suitable for the collection of drinking water.\nAS/NZS 2728 has been deemed ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as allowing accelerated testing to\ndetermine colour fastness and durability. Such tests have been found to be an unreliable indication of a system's\nperformance in real-life situations. MRM has therefore adopted an interpretation of this standard as the\ncompliance standard for its members.

The dry film builds are high compared to pre-\nprimed or coil-coated products and the films seal any micro-cracking of the metallic coating that may have\noccurred in the forming process.\nThe corrosion performance of the post-painted factory-applied finished products is influenced by the substrate.\nThe use of Aluminium Zinc metallic coating (AZ) has been proven to work extremely well with post-painted\nfinishes in almost all environments.\nThe coatings are durable with expected first-time recoating maintenance of over 15 years. Touch-up of these\ncoatings is possible as the same coating formulation can be applied in the field. As with any organic coating,\nthere will be a gradual breakdown of the resin systems which may result in chalking of the surface.\nChalking is the result of erosion of the surface coating and slight colour changes may occur as the surface resin\nis eroded. The extent of change depends on the pigments used and also the gloss level, a coating that started as\na matt finish will change very little while a gloss finish will appear to have changed more.\nGranule-textured finishes are created using crushed rock, comprising either natural rock or natural rock coated\nwith a ceramic finish containing light-fast inorganic pigments. Both the natural rock and ceramic-coated granules\nprovide exceptional long-term colour durability. The coatings used to adhere the granules to the substrate are\ndesigned to be flexible in all environments and, although durable, the coating is protected from UV by the UV\nopaque granules.\nA clear coating is applied to the granules during the coating process, which helps bond the granules into the\nadhesive base coating and provides a robust surface reducing any damage during the transportation and\ninstallation process. As this clear coat weathers, it exposes the natural or coated surface of the granules, which\nis slightly duller than the initial finish.\n4.18.3 \nPowder Coating \nPowder coating is generally used to colour match accessories used with pre-painted steel cladding and rainwater\ngoods. The use of powder coating on metallic coated steel roof and wall cladding and flashings is not\nrecommended for the following reasons.\nIt will fade at a noticeably different rate to adjacent pre-painted metal surfaces.\nPowder coated products are length limited by the size of the curing oven and cannot be re-formed after\ncoating.\nDrilling or cutting of the sheet after powder coating will create an exposed edge vulnerable to under-cut\ncorrosion.\nStandard powder coating does not have the corrosion resistance of pre-painted metal and is vulnerable to post\ncoating damage and edge creep corrosion.\nIt is difficult to obtain adhesion to powder coated surfaces when overpainting, and the remaining powder coat\nsurface may not provide a good substrate for such.\nPower coating may be used to colour match accessories but cannot be relied upon to increase durability, unless\nspecific pre-treatment and powder coating systems are specified and applied.\n4.18.4 \n 4 DURABILITY\n 18 \n 4.18 \n165\nThis is a controlled document.
