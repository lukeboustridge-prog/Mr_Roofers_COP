The relationship between the rise and the\nhorizontal distance is known as the tangent of the angle and is calculated by using tan f = O/A (being the opposite\nside divided by the adjacent side). See 18.2 Pitch & Rise Calculator.\n18.7A Measuring Stick Method\n250/1000 = 0.25 = 14 deg (1 in 4)\nN.B. Angles A and B are equal.\nIt is possible to obtain the length of the hypotenuse by using a2 + b2\nCricket flashings as described in section 6 can be made to suit any penetration width, any cricket flashing depth\nto width ratio and roof pitch down to 3 deg . For simplicity, three angles have been selected.\nf X = 45 deg \nf Y = 27 deg \nf Z = 18 deg \nVARIATION OF CRICKET VALLEY DESIGN DEPENDENT ON DEPTH AND ROOF PITCH\nPenetration Width = 2A\nDepth \n= D\nValley \n= V\n18.7B Cricket Variations\n 18 \n 18.7 CRICKET PENETRATION PATTERNS\n 7 \n 18 \n 18.7 \n506\nThis is a controlled document.

If the depth of the cricket is half of the width of the penetration, as shown for 'Cricket X'\nthe angles are at 45 deg and there is a defined relationship between the length of the valley of the\ncricket and the width of the penetration and also between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and\nthe pitch of the roof.\nThis is 1 : 2 = 1.42, which means that to maintain the desired 3 deg fall in the cricket valley, the\nminimum roof pitch (4 deg ) can be calculated using table 15.8.\nIf the depth of the cricket is a quarter or a sixth of the width of the penetration, there are also\ndefined relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch of the roof.\nThese are described in table 18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket\nand the pitch of the roof as 'Cricket Y' and 'Cricket Z'.\nAll figures comply with the minimum fall of 1.5 deg , but all the bold figures will provide a 3 deg cricket\nvalley pitch. This methodology is valid for all sizes of penetration. However, there is a point at\nwhich, having a design with a wide penetration and a low pitch, it becomes uneconomic to pursue\nthe ideal 3 deg fall in the cricket valley. When the roof pitch is known, the minimum allowable fall of\nthe cricket valley pitch (1.5 deg ) can then be read from table 15.8.\nIt is permissible to lower the valley pitch because 1.5 deg allows sufficient fall to clear debris from the\nvalley and therefore qualifies as a warrantable flashing.\nA diverter flashing without a cricket design only shifts the position of the cricket to the top over-\nflashing of the penetration as shown on drawing 9.7.6B Cricket Flashings, unless the penetration\nis rotated 45 deg as shown on drawing 9.7.6C Diverter Flashings.\n18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch\nof the roof\nROOF PITCH\n3 deg \n4 deg \n5 deg \n6 deg \n7 deg \n8 deg \n9 deg \n10 deg \nTANGENT\n.0524\n.0699\n.0875\n.1051\n.1228\n.1405\n.1584\n1763\nCRICKET X\n2 deg \n3 deg \n3.5 deg \n4.5 deg \n10 deg \nCRICKET Y\n1.5 deg \n1.75 deg \n2.25 deg \n2.75 deg \n3.25 deg \n8 deg \n9 deg \n10 deg \nCRICKET Z\nn/a\nn/a\n1.5 deg \n2 deg \n2.25 deg \n2.5 deg \n3 deg \n3.5 deg \nPROCEDURE TO MAKE A HALF PATTERN FOR A CRICKET PENETRATION FLASHING\nExample:\nA net penetration width is 550 mm wide and gross width to the flat of the pans is 620 mm (2A).\n 18 \n 18.7 CRICKET PENETRATION PATTERNS\n 7 \n 18 \n 18.7 \n507\nThis is a controlled document.

This methodology is valid for all sizes of penetration. However, there is a point at\nwhich, having a design with a wide penetration and a low pitch, it becomes uneconomic to pursue\nthe ideal 3 deg fall in the cricket valley. When the roof pitch is known, the minimum allowable fall of\nthe cricket valley pitch (1.5 deg ) can then be read from table 15.8.\nIt is permissible to lower the valley pitch because 1.5 deg allows sufficient fall to clear debris from the\nvalley and therefore qualifies as a warrantable flashing.\nA diverter flashing without a cricket design only shifts the position of the cricket to the top over-\nflashing of the penetration as shown on drawing 9.7.6B Cricket Flashings, unless the penetration\nis rotated 45 deg as shown on drawing 9.7.6C Diverter Flashings.\nof the roof\nROOF PITCH\n3 deg \n4 deg \n5 deg \n6 deg \n7 deg \n8 deg \n9 deg \n10 deg \nTANGENT\n.0524\n.0699\n.0875\n.1051\n.1228\n.1405\n.1584\n1763\nCRICKET X\n2 deg \n3 deg \n3.5 deg \n4.5 deg \n10 deg \nCRICKET Y\n1.5 deg \n1.75 deg \n2.25 deg \n2.75 deg \n3.25 deg \n8 deg \n9 deg \n10 deg \nCRICKET Z\nn/a\nn/a\n1.5 deg \n2 deg \n2.25 deg \n2.5 deg \n3 deg \n3.5 deg \nPROCEDURE TO MAKE A HALF PATTERN FOR A CRICKET PENETRATION FLASHING\nExample:\nA net penetration width is 550 mm wide and gross width to the flat of the pans is 620 mm (2A).\n 18 USEFUL INFORMATION\n 18 \n 18.7 CRICKET PENETRATION PATTERNS\n 7 \n 18 \n 18.7 \n507\nThis is a controlled document.
