The relationship between the rise and the\nhorizontal distance is known as the tangent of the angle and is calculated by using tan f = O/A (being the opposite\nside divided by the adjacent side). See 18.2 Pitch & Rise Calculator.\n18.7A Measuring Stick Method\n250/1000 = 0.25 = 14 deg (1 in 4)\nN.B. Angles A and B are equal.\nIt is possible to obtain the length of the hypotenuse by using a2 + b2\nCricket flashings as described in section 6 can be made to suit any penetration width, any cricket flashing depth\nto width ratio and roof pitch down to 3 deg . For simplicity, three angles have been selected.\nf X = 45 deg\nf Y = 27 deg\nf Z = 18 deg\nVARIATION OF CRICKET VALLEY DESIGN DEPENDENT ON DEPTH AND ROOF PITCH\nPenetration Width = 2A\nDepth\n= D\nValley\n= V\n18.7B Cricket Variations\n\nf X = 45 deg\nD = A\nV = 2 = 1.42\nf Y = 27 deg\nD = 1/2A\nV = 1.25 = 1.118\nf Z = 18 deg\nD = 1/3A\nV = 1.11 = 1.054\nTo find the cricket valley pitch when the roof pitch is known, it is necessary to find the depth (D) of\nthe cricket. If the depth of the cricket is half of the width of the penetration, as shown for 'Cricket X'\nthe angles are at 45 deg and there is a defined relationship between the length of the valley of the\ncricket and the width of the penetration and also between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and\nthe pitch of the roof.\nThis is 1 : 2 = 1.42, which means that to maintain the desired 3 deg fall in the cricket valley, the\nminimum roof pitch (4 deg ) can be calculated using table 15.8.\nIf the depth of the cricket is a quarter or a sixth of the width of the penetration, there are also\ndefined relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch of the roof.\nThese are described in table 18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket\nand the pitch of the roof as 'Cricket Y' and 'Cricket Z'.\nAll figures comply with the minimum fall of 1.5 deg , but all the bold figures will provide a 3 deg cricket\nvalley pitch. This methodology is valid for all sizes of penetration. However, there is a point at\nwhich, having a design with a wide penetration and a low pitch, it becomes uneconomic to pursue\nthe ideal 3 deg fall in the cricket valley. When the roof pitch is known, the minimum allowable fall of\nthe cricket valley pitch (1.5 deg ) can then be read from table 15.8.\nIt is permissible to lower the valley pitch because 1.5 deg allows sufficient fall to clear debris from the\nvalley and therefore qualifies as a warrantable flashing.\nA diverter flashing without a cricket design only shifts the position of the cricket to the top over-\nflashing of the penetration as shown on drawing 9.7.6B Cricket Flashings, unless the penetration\nis rotated 45 deg as shown on drawing 9.7.6C Diverter Flashings.\n18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch\nof the roof\nROOF PITCH\n3 deg\n4 deg\n5 deg\n6 deg\n7 deg\n8 deg\n9 deg\n10 deg\nTANGENT\n.0524\n.0699\n.0875\n.1051\n.1228\n.1405\n.1584\n1763\nCRICKET X\n2 deg\n3 deg\n3.5 deg\n4.5 deg\n10 deg\nCRICKET Y\n1.5 deg\n1.75 deg\n2.25 deg\n2.75 deg\n3.25 deg\n8 deg\n9 deg\n10 deg\nCRICKET Z\nn/a\nn/a\n1.5 deg\n2 deg\n2.25 deg\n2.5 deg\n3 deg\n3.5 deg\nPROCEDURE TO MAKE A HALF PATTERN FOR A CRICKET PENETRATION FLASHING\nExample:\nA net penetration width is 550 mm wide and gross width to the flat of the pans is 620 mm (2A).\n\nHalf the width of the cricket\nDepth of the Y cricket from drawing 15.8.B (D=1/2A)\nHeight of the side curb\nHeight to the top of the cricket\nH - Hc = Hr\nFrom Drawing 15.8.C\nFind the length of V, S and R.\nRight angle triangle, therefore, the length of V.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\nRight angle triangle, therefore, the length of R.\nRight angle triangle, therefore, the length of S.\nThe back curb is required to have a fall of 3 deg .\nThe roof pitch is 7 deg .\nFrom Table 18.7C Relationships between the pitch of the valley of the cricket and the pitch of\nthe roof . select the cricket - Type Y\nGiven:\nA = 310mm\nD = 155mm\nH = 130mm\nHc = 70mm\nHr = 60mm\nV = A2 + D2\nA = 346 mm\nR = Hc + D\nR = 170 mm\nS = A + Hc\nR = 318 mm\n18.7D Cricket Pattern\nDRAW A HALF PATTERN\nDraw a dotted line K - L length equal to A\nFrom L draw a dotted line at right angles L - M length equal to D\nDraw the line K - M (length equal to V)\nWith centre M scribe an arc length equal to R\n\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\nWith centre K scribe an arc length equal to S\nFrom their point of intersection, N draw a line to K and also to M\nWith centre K scribe an arc length equal to H.\nWith centre N scribe an arc length equal to Hr.\nDraw a line as a tangent to the two arcs\nFrom point K, draw a line at right angles to intersect this line at O.\nFrom O measure length A to a point P\nThe shape K-M-N-P-O is the net cricket pattern\n18.7E Drawing a Cricket Half-Pattern\n18.7F Assembling a Cricket Penetration\nSheet Metal Work For Roofing Contractors.\nWhen forming various flashings in sheet-metal the Roofing Contractor is required to know how to\ncut the material in order to obtain the desired shape.\nBasic knowledge of geometrical drawing and mensuration is required and this section explains the\nmethods which are employed to ensure accurate results.\nA straight line. A straight line is a line drawn in the shortest manner between two given points, so\nany other line between these points is a curved line.\n18.8A Parallel Lines\nParallel lines are lines which, when extended, do not touch. Given a line CD, to draw a parallel line set a compass\nto the required distance apart and with C and D as centres, describe two arcs. A line drawn as a tangent to both\narcs will be a parallel line to CD.\n18.8B Perpendicular Line\nTo draw a perpendicular line. Given a straight line EF, set a compass to any distance more than half the distance EF\nand, with E and F as centres, describe arcs of radius EG and FH.\nA line drawn through the points of intersection of these arcs is perpendicular to EF and bisects the distance EF.\n\n18.8C Dividing a line into equal parts\nTo divide a line into any number of equal parts. Given a straight line J K, draw another line J L at any suitable angle\nand no particular length. Set off on JL, at any reasonable distance apart, a number of equal spaces similar in\nnumber to the parts into which JK is to be divided.\nConnect L and K with a line, and parallel to this draw other lines through points on JL. These divide JK into the\nrequired number of equal parts.\n18.8D Bisecting an Arc\nGiven an arc AB, set a compass to a distance a little more than half that between the ends and with A and B as\ncentres, describe arcs of equal radii.\nA line drawn through the points of intersection will bisect AB. This method can be employed to divide the arc into\nany number of even parts by repetition. Further, the method may be used to find the centre of any given arc by\nfurther bisecting AC and CB.\nLines taken through the intersecting points of these latter arcs, when produced, will intersect at the centre of the\narc AB.\n18.8E Bisecting an Angle\nGiven an angle ABC, set off equal distances BD and BE and with D and E as centres and a compass set at any\nreasonable radius, describe arcs to intersect in F. A line drawn through B and F bisects the angle.\n\n18.8F Dividing a Circle into Six Equal Parts\n Set a compass to the radius of the circle and step this distance off along the circumference. Further division into\n12 parts may be done by bisecting one part, and again stepping off with the radius of the circle\n18.8G Developing the Frustrum of a True Cone\nDraw the elevation X with base diameter AB, the vertical height CD to the desired cone angle and add the section\nline EF to the elevation. With centre D and radius DA describe a semicircle Y on the base, and divide the\ncircumference of this into six equal parts.\nTo draw the development Z: With centre C and radius CB, describe an arc AA whose length equals the\ncircumference of cone base.\nThis may be obtained by marking off along the arc from A spaces equal to parts in the semicircle Y but double in\nnumber.(12)\nWith C as centre and radius CE, draw the arc EE1 and add the line CA.\nThe figure AA1E1E is the development Z of the frustrum.\nTo do this, drop a perpendicular from F to F and extend the base line AB.\nAn offset diagram is now made by measuring distances BF, BG, and BH, setting these off from\nF on base line AB and drawing lines to F.\nThe lengths FF, FG, and FH, etc., are now true lengths.\nTo draw the development Z:\nDraw a centre line CO. At right angles to C draw AB equal to AB.\nFrom C1, set off distance C1F1, equal to FB.\n\nJoin A and B to F. With centre A and radius FG, draw a short arc to be cut by an arc of FG\nradius struck from F1 to obtain point G1.\nSimilarly, with A as centre and radius FH, draw an arc, to be cut by an arc of GH radius struck\nfrom point G, thus obtaining point H.\nDraw a line through, A and H and produce same to intersect the centre line CO at O.\nRepeat the process with. B as centre for long radii, thus completing one quarter of the whole\ndevelopment.\nTo complete the pattern, draw a curve through points HGF and repeat in the other sections of the\ndevelopment.\n18.8H Developing a Square Base to a Circular Top\nDraw the elevation X, making the base AB, vertical height CD, and diameter of top EF.\nDraw a half plan Y on the base, drawing the semicircle E1F1 and dividing one half of this into a number of equal\nparts, FG, GH, HJ, and JK.\nThrough points F, G, H, J, and K, draw lines to B.\nBefore proceeding to the development it is necessary to find the true lengths of BK, BJ, BH, BG, and BF.","pdfPages":[490,491,492,493,494,495,496,497,498,499,500,501,502,503,504,505,506,507,508,509,510,511,512,513],"subsections":[{"number":"18.1","title":"Conversion Factors","level":2,"content":"18.1A Measurement Conversions\nTo convert from this\ninto this\nTo convert this back\nmultiply by this\ndivide by this\natmosphere\nmillibar\n1013.25\natmosphere\npascal\n101.325\ncubic foot\ncubic metre\n0.028317\ncubic inch\ncubic millimetre\n16387.1\ncubic yard\ncubic metre\n0.764555\nfoot\nmetre\n0.3048\nfoot per minute\nmetre per minute\n0.3048\nfoot per minute\nmetre per second\n0.00508\nfoot per second\nmetre per second\n0.3048\nfoot pound force per second\nwatt\n1.35582\ngallon (Imp)\nlitre\n4.54609\ngallon (US)\nlitre\n3.78541\ninch\nmetre\n0.0254\ninch\nmillimetre\n25.4\ninch mercury\nkilopascal\n3.38638\ninch water gauge\nkilopascal\n0.248642\nkilogram\nkN\n\nkilometre per hour\nknot\n0.539\nknot\nkilometre per hour\n1.852\nknot\nnautical mile/h\n\nknot\nft/h\n6080\nknot\nmetre per second\n0.515\nmetre Head of water\nkPa\n9.8\nmile\nkilometre\n1.609344\nmile per hour\nkilometre per hour\n1.609344\nmillimetre mercury\nkilopascal\n0.133322\nmillimetre water gauge\npascal\n9.78904\nMPa\nkip\n6.895\nounce\ngram\n28.3495\nounce per square foot\ngram per square metre\n305.152\nounce per square yard\ngram per square metre\n33.9057\npound\nkilogram\n0.45359237\npound force\nnewton\n4.44822\n\n=\nmillibar\n\npound force foot\nnewton.metre\n1.35582\npound force inch\nnewton.metre\n0.112985\npound force per square foot\nkilopascal\n0.0479\npound force per square inch\nbar\n0.69\npound force per square inch\npascal\n6894.76\npound force per square inch\nkilopascal\n6.89476\npound force per square inch\nmegapascal\n0.006895\npound per cubic foot\nkilogram per cubic metre\n16.0185\npound per foot\nkilogram per metre\n1.48816\npound per square foot\nkilogram per square metre\n4.882\nsquare foot\nsquare metre\n0.092903\nsquare foot per ton\nsquare metre per tonne\n0.091436\nsquare inch\nsquare millimetre\n645.16\nsquare mile\nsquare kilometre\n2.59\nsquare yard\nsquare metre\n0.836127\nSteel thickness in mm\nWeight of steel kgs/m\n7.85\nton\ntonne\n1.01605\nton force foot\nkilonewton metre\n3.03703\nton force per square inch\nmegapascal\n15.4443\nton per cubic yard\ntonne per cubic metre\n1.32894\nton, freight (40 ft)\ncubic metre\n1.13267\nyard\nkilometre\n0.000914\nTo convert from this\ninto this\nTo convert this back\nmultiply by this\ndivide by this\nWater 0 -
