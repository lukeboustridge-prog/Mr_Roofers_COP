Loads are derived from AS/NZS 1170, and those loads have been used to develop prescriptive\nsolutions such as found in NZS 3604, NASH, and the Code of Practice load/span tables.\n3.2.1\nAS/AZS 1170.2:2011\nDesigners should be familiar with the current Loadings Code, including amendments. Manufacturers' printed\ntechnical literature should comply with the current requirements of ASA/NZS 1170.\nThe Loadings Code identifies four load categories relevant to metal roof and wall cladding.\nWind actions:\nWind imposed inwards forces (pressure) where the wind is slowed, and outward pressures\n(suction) where the wind accelerates. The shape of the structure induces local pressure factors\nwhere pressure is concentrated. Internal pressures may also be generated within a building.\nPermanent action:\nDead load is the permanent weight of the roof structure and the permanent part of an imposed\nload, such as an air conditioning unit.\nImposed action:\nLive loads are variable loads imposed on the building by its occupants and contents, such as a\nperson standing on the roof (point load).\nInduced actions:\nLoads such as wind, snow or ice, and ponding rainwater.\nWhen a structure, or part of it, fails to fulfil its expected basic functions, it is said to have reached a limit state;\nthe two limit states are Serviceability Failure and Ultimate Failure. (see 3.7 Modes of Failure.)\n3.2.2\nNZS 3604:2011\nNZS 3604 Timber Framed Buildings is an acceptable solution to comply with the NZBC for light timber frame\nbuildings not requiring specific design.\nIt contains prescriptive dimensions for purlin spacing and fasteners, based on maximum design wind speeds of\nLow (32 m/s), Medium (37 m/s), High (44 m/s), Very High (50 m/s), or Extra High (55 m/s). The load calculations\nfor NZS3604 were based on a simplified interpretation of AS/NZS 1170. These values can be used for calculation\nof loads on the cladding of structures designed using NZS 3604.\nNZS 3604 includes:\nTimber frame construction.\nHeight from lowest ground to the highest point on the roof may not exceed 10 m.\nA snow load may not exceed 1.0 kPa, although Section 15 of NZS 3604 does provide additional criteria for\n1.5 kPa and 2.0 kPa snow loads.\nNZS 3604 excludes:\n\nbuildings dedicated to the preservation of human life;\nbuildings which may host crowds;\npublicly owned buildings containing high value contents; and\ncurved roof construction.\nBecause the buildings covered by this standard are limited in size, wind loads include a local pressure factor of\n1.5 kPa over the entire structure, rather than varying factors according to the position on the roof as required by\nAS/NZS 1170.2:2011.\n3.2.3\nNASH Standard\nNash Standard Part 2 is cited in B1/AS1 as an Acceptable Solution for light steel framed buildings within a scope\nsimilar to that of NZS 3604\nPerformance\nA structural steel member typically comprises elements named webs and flanges. In a roofing profile the sides of\nthe rib act as a web, and the pan and crest act as flanges.\n3.3A Profiled Steel - Flanges and Webs\nFlange\nFlange\nWeb\nFlange\nWeb\nC-Section\n-Beam\nFlange\nRoof\nLip\nSteel is strong in tension but can be weak in compression if the profile is not optimised.\nProfiled metal cladding acts as a beam, which derives its strength from the ability of its flanges, separated by the\nweb to resist tensile and compressive forces. This strength can only be maintained while those parts in\ncompression are restrained from buckling.\nThe geometry of the profile shape, together with the material thickness and strength, determines the load\ncapacity of the profile. Manufacturing variations of tested profiles will produce different results in pierced-\nfastened profiles, under load and may produce vastly different results in clip-fixed profiles.\n3.3.1\nSection Properties\nProfile strength can be determined by analysis of sectional properties, but this will not accurately predict their\nperformance under load, as the profile shape, and therefore the sectional properties, change during deflection.\nOnly physical testing can prove the actual capabilities of the profile.\nProfiles\nProfile familes can broadly be segregated as pierce fastened (corrugate, trapezoidal), and secret fix (tray and\ntrough). Within these broad categories there are subsets.\n3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal - Minimum Depth 45 mm\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal - Minimum Depth 30 mm\nAsymmetrical Trapezoidal Low Rib - Minimum Depth 19mm\nCorrugate - Minimum Depth 16.5mm\nTrapezoidal Symmetrical - Minimum Depth 19 mm\nSymmetrical corrugate or trapezoidal profiles have the advantage of being more easily curved around a radius.\nBecause the ribs are necessarily close together, they have the disadvantage of roof traffic loads having to be\nspread over two crests, and they have a lower run-off capacity.\n3.4.1\nCorrugate Profile\nThe corrugated profile has been used in New Zealand for over 150 years and there has been only one significant\nchange during that period.\nIn the 1960s the steel grade used for roof and wall cladding changed from low-strength steel (250MPa or G250)\nto high-strength steel (550 MPa or G550). The number of corrugations also changed from 8 to 10.5, which enabled\nthe sheets to be laid either side up, as opposed to over-and-under.\nThe standard corrugation profile has 17.5 mm deep crests at 76 mm spacings, but smaller and deeper alternatives\nare also available.\nCorrugate cladding is formed with a slightly asymmetrical overlap profile to a capillary barrier.\n3.4.2\nTrapezoidal Profile\nThe trapezoidal shape provides greater water carrying capacity and provides greater spanning capabilities than\ncorrugate profile.\n\nThe angle and height of the trapezoid rib determines the profiles performance under compression. A deeper rib\ngenerally gives improved performance, but lowers the effective coverage of the sheet.\nTrapezoidal profiles are available with different ribs heights (see 3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles).\n3.4.3\nMiniature Profiles\nVarious miniature cladding profiles are manufactured in New Zealand, the most common being known variously\nunder the names of mini-corrugate, sparrow iron, baby iron and mini-iron.\nMini-corrugate is sometimes used for small roof areas, such as spires and awnings. It is most commonly used\nfor wall cladding, parapets and internal linings where studs are normally spaced at 600 mm centres or less.\nSome miniature trapezoidal profiles are also manufactured specifically for wall cladding.\n3.4.4\nSecret-fixed Profiles\n3.4.4A Secret-fixed Profiles\nTrough Profile - Minimum Depth 38mm\nTray may be profiled\nStanding Seam/Tray Profile -\nMinimum Depth 25 mm\nSecret fixed profiles are attached to the structure by clips rather than by pierce fasteners. This allows for freer\nthermal movement and minimises the number of penetrations in the cladding. The steep sided ribs and wide pans\ntypical of secret fixed profiles gives greater water carrying capacity, and facilitates watertight flashing design.\nTraditionally they were used for pitches as low as 1 deg but due to durability issues caused by deflection and\nresultant ponding the recommended minimum pitch is now 3 deg .\nTrough sections generally have 2 to 3 pans or trays 180 - 250 mm in width. Tray roofing has a single pan of up to\n550 mm in width.\nStanding Seam is a subset of tray roofing. Standing seam roofs are based on traditional manufacturing methods\n(using folding and hand tool rather than roll forming), but now they are available roll-formed in most itirations.\n(See 15.4 Tray Roofing)\n3.4.5\nMaterial Grade\n\nTo test for tensile strength the material is subjected to a longitudinal (stretching) load, and values are taken for\nyield strength (when it permanently deforms) and tensile strength (when it breaks). Elongation is also measured\nduring this test.\nThe minimum tensile strength defines the grade of steel, eg, G550 for high-strength light gauge steel, but to\ncomply with this grade the yield strength and elongation must also fall within defined parameters.\nYield strength is an important determinant of the strength of a profile, along with profile shape and material\nthickness. High tensile material will have more resistance to failure such as buckling around the fastener under\nwind uplift, pull-through of the fastener head, or buckling under foot traffic load. However, tensile strength has a\nnegligible effect on deflection under load.\nWhere 0.55 material is specified for straight corrugate or trapezoidal roofing, it is unacceptable to substitute\nG300 for G550 grade material as the resultant profile will have little strength advantage over 0.40 mm G550.\nAluminium is defined by a hardness grade ranging from H32 to H38. Typically, H34 is used for flashings, severe\nprofiles such as trough sections, and profiles that are to be curved. Most corrugated and Trapezoidal profiles are\nmanufactured using H36.\nIt must be remembered that the alloy also affects strength. H36 aluminium in 5005 or 5025 alloys, which are\ntypically used in New Zealand, will have considerably greater tensile strength than the same grade in a 3000-\nseries alloy.\n3.4.5A End Use for Typical Alloys\nMaterial\nGradeTypical End Use\nSteel\nG300 Flashings, ridging, spouting, curving, some trough sections.\nG550 Corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, some trough sections.\nAluminium 5505/5025H32\nLock seaming\nH34\nFlashings, curved roofing, trough sections, and tray roofing.\nH 36 Flashings and profiled roofing, trapezoidal sections, and corrugate.\n\n3.4.5B Tensile Testing\n\n3.4.5C Typical Result for G550 Steel\n3.4.6\nMaterial Thickness\nMaterial thickness has a great bearing on load capacity and buckling resistance. For residential buildings, 0.40\nmm thickness material is most commonly used for corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, and this will normally be\nsufficient to withstand the statutory wind loads at typical spans and fastener spacings in up to High Wind\n\nZones. In higher wind speeds, it is often more effective to use 0.55 mm material, rather than reducing purlin and\nfastener spacings.\nMaterial with a 0.40 mm thickness is very vulnerable to foot traffic damage in most profile configurations and\nrequires careful and accurate foot placement to avoid buckling. In residential buildings with high foot traffic\nexpectancy or highly visible roofs, eg, multi-level mono-pitch roofs, roofs with UV collectors, flues, aircon\ndevices, chimneys that need servicing, or prestige housing 0.55 mm material should be selected.\nFor commercial and industrial applications, 0.55 mm is almost universally used on the roof, and 0.40 mm is most\ncommon on walls.\nIn addition to 0.40 mm and 0.55 mm, 0.48 mm G550 steel is often used for high tensile trough sections, which will\noften compare in strength to similar profiles manufactured from 0.55 mm G300 material. Most roofing profiles\ncan also be manufactured from 0.75 mm G550 material where greater robustness and resistance to foot traffic\nare desired.\nMaterial is available with other thicknesses; for example, 0.63 mm material is often manufactured for the Pacific\nislands, and 0.35 mm is sometimes used to manufacture specialist wall cladding.\nLoads\nThe performance and optimal use of metal cladding is affected by the different types of load it is subjected to\nduring the course of its lifetime. These loads can be broadly categorised as point load and uniformly distributed\nload (UDL).\nModes of failure and fastener loads are discussed in other clauses under the main clause 3 Structure.\n3.5.1\nUnderstanding Loads\nThe performance of profiled metal cladding under load depends on its ability to resist the tension (stretching),\ncompression (squashing), and shear (sliding) forces that it is likely to be subjected to during the lifetime of the\nbuilding.\n3.5.1A Compression, Tensile and Shear Force\nCOMPRESSION\nTENSION\nSHEAR\nLoad\nForce\nWhen a beam is subjected to bending, one flange will be under compression and the other under tension.\nLoads acting on roof cladding are generally classified into two types: point load and uniformly distributed load\n(UDL). A point load is applied to a particular area, but a UDL impacts on the total area of the roof.\n3.5.1.1\nContinuity\nOptimum performance of roof cladding under load depends on the continuity over several spans.\nAn adjacent continuous span assists the performance of profiled metal cladding, as continuity can\nreduce deflection up to 50%. In single spans the cladding is free to rotate at each support, but with\ncontinuity at a support the cladding is held down by an adjacent span; reducing the rotation and\ndeflection.\n\n3.5.1.1A Continuity\nEND\nEnd span should be 2/3 intermediate\nThe end span of profiled metal cladding should be no more than two-thirds of the intermediate span for optimum\nperformance under both point load.\n3.5.1.2\nLoad Distribution\nLoad distribution greatly affects the deflection. A load distributed equally along the length of a beam (line load)\nwill cause less deflection than the same load being applied to the centre of the beam.\n3.5.1.2A Little deflection with a line load.\n\n3.5.1.2B Increased deflection with Point Load.\n\nThe depth of the profile of metal cladding is another important criterion in the design and use of metal roof and\nwall cladding. Given the same cross section area, the deflection of the profile will vary with the square of the\ndepth, with the trade-off of higher buckling modes.\n3.5.1.2C Deflection and the Square of Depth\nFORCE\nFORCE\nFORCE\nDeflection\n16x\nDeflection\n4x\nDeflection\nx\nTypes of Load\nLoads acting on roof cladding are generally classified into two types: point load and uniformly distributed Load\n(UDL)\nCladding reacts differently to a point load and a UDL. A point load is applied to a particular area, but a UDL\nimpacts on the total area of the roof.\n3.6.1\nPoint Load\nMost roofing profiles will resist far greater point loads when the load is applied to the pan of the profile rather\nthan the rib. When the load is applied to the pan, the load is shared by the adjacent ribs. Alternatively, loads may\nbe applied over two or more ribs.\nTesting loads may be applied to the pan or the rib depending of the profile shape and the design criteria. See\n3.7.4 Roof Traffic.\nTrafficable roofs must be designed to withstand a point load which is representative of a worker with a bag of\ntools. It is calculated at 112 kg, which equals 1.1 kN force.\nIn the case of an imposed load, such as an air conditioning unit which is supported directly by the roof cladding,\nthe unit weight per support and area of contact is calculated to arrive at point loads.\nA point load on a roof is always positive or downward (+).\n\n3.6.1A Point Load Test at the MRM\n3.6.2\nUniformly Distributed Load (Wind or Induced Action)\nA Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) is commonly either a wind load or a snow load.\nThese loads are variable and depend on factors such as the location, topography, and\nposition on the structure, but do not often exceed 6 kPa. The most severe wind load is usually an\nuplift load, or negative (-), and snow load is a downward load or positive (+).\n3.6.2.1\nWind Load\nThe wind load imposed on a roof structure is taken to apply at right angles to the roof cladding over a nominated\narea. The design wind load is affected by the design of the building and is modified using factors called pressure\ncoefficients. Wind design load is measured in kilopascal (kPa); 1 kPa equals 1 kN/m.\n\n3.6.2.1A Wind Uplift Load\nNegative pressure\nPositive pressure\nExternal wind pressure: Gable view\nFast speed = Lower pressure\nSlow speed = higher pressure\nLift\nUnder wind loads, inwards loads are resisted by the purlin or girts, whilst outward loads are only resisted by the\nfastener head or clip. Therefore, outwards load is the more critical figure.\nEngineers calculate both the serviceability load and the ultimate load. They compare these values with the\nmaximum failure loads of the products and systems they are considering.\nLoad/span data for standard corrugate, and low rib 5 and 6 ribbed trapezoidals is at the end of this section.\n3.6.2.1B Load/Span Data clauses\nDesign\nSteel\nAluminium\nNZS\n3604\n3.10.1 G550 Steel Roof Fastening Pattern\nTables\n3.10.3 Aluminium Fastening Pattern Tables\nSED\n3.11.2 Steel Cladding Wind Load Span\nGraphs\n3.11.3 Aluminium Cladding Wind Load Span\nGraphs\nRefer to manufacturer's load/span tables for all other profiles, which should give the maximum recommended\nload for continuous spans when tested as described in 17.1.3 Testing Procedure.\n\n3.6.2.1C Sheltered by Trees, \"Urban Terrain\"\nScattered obstructions of a similar height or lower within 500 m from a building will considerably lessen wind\nspeeds and lower design wind pressures.\n3.6.2.1D Surrounded by flat ground, \"Open Terrain\"\nStructures in open land such as flat pasture and playing fields, or by water, will be subjected to higher design\nwind pressures.\n3.6.2.1E Topographical Influences\nTerrain also has a big effect. Structures near the crest of a rise or on flat land near a steep face will have increased\ndesign wind pressure.\nWind Design Load is affected by building design factors such as building height, shape, proportions, orientation,\nand roof pitch. Permeability can also be a big factor; buildings with large openings on one side but completely\nclosed on the other three sides will suffer high internal wind pressures. These internal pressures must be added\nto the suction load on the outside of the roof when calculating wind design load.\nLocal territorial authorities are usually able to give wind speed figures for a specific address in their area. All\nother factors, including topographical influences, internal, and local pressure factors must be considered by a\nsuitably qualified professional to calculate the design wind load on a structure.\nLocal Pressure Factor (Kl)\nThe local pressure factor (Kl) is an important design consideration required by the Loadings Standard. The\nperipheral areas of roof and wall surfaces are subjected to greater uplift loads than the main body of the roof.\nDesigners need to include local pressure factors in the calculation of wind loads on the cladding.\nWhen determining fixing requirements to NZS 1170.2, the engineer should prepare a roof map showing purlin\nspans and local pressure factors for each section of the cladding.\nWhen designing to NZS 1170 the local pressure factors are:\n1.5-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.2 or 20% of the width or height of the\nbuilding whichever is the least.\n2.0-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.1 or 10% of the width or height whichever is\nthe least.\n3.0-applied to roof pitches less than 10 deg , at the corners where the dimensions in (a) intersect. It also applies\nto corners of walls where the building height is greater than the building width.\n3.6.2.1.1A Local Pressure for Low-Pitch Roofs\na = Lesser of:\nLocal Pressure (Kl) factors as per AS/NZS 1170:2011\nKl 1.5\nKl 2.0\nKl 3.0\nY\nX\nPitch <10 deg\nRidge\nPitches below 10 deg do not have local pressure factors at the ridge\na\na\n0.5 x Building Height, or\n0.2 x Building width, or\n0.2 x Building length\n\n3.6.2.1.1B Local Pressure Factors for Roofpitch over 10 deg\na = Lesser of:\n0.5 x Building Height, or\n0.1 x Building width, or\n0.1 x Building length\nKl 1.5\nKl 2.0\nKl 3.0\nY\nX\nPitch >10 deg\nRidge\na\na\na\na\na\na\nOn smaller roofs the local pressure factors comprise a sizeable portion of the roof,\nespecially where pitch exceeds 10 degrees.\nLocal Pressure (Kl) factors as per AS/NZS 1170:2011\n3.6.2.1.2\nConversion of Wind Speed To Pressure\nThe basic formula for converting a wind speed to wind load is: 0.6 x velocity = wind load. However, to get a true\ndesign wind speed is a lot more complex; various factors have to be applied including roof self-weight, internal\npressure and local pressure coefficients.\nThe most influential of these factors is generally the local pressure factor, but internal pressure can also have a\nprofound influence-particularly on unlined structures.\n3.6.2.2\nSnow Loads\nRoof cladding design does not usually have to be altered for snow load, maximum snow load in New Zealand\n(under NZS 3604) is a UDL of 2 kPa.This is less than the upwards load in a Very High Wind Zone, however, as it is\na downwards load, restraint is linear by the purlins, rather than point restraint by the fasteners, so greater capacity\nis achieved.\nAny profile-gauge combination that will resist a wind load of Very High or Extra High Wind Zone with fasteners at\neach crest, will adequately resist a 2 kPa snow load. It may, however, be neccessary to increase the strength of\nthe structure to allow for induced snow loads.\nNZS 3604 divides New Zealand into six zones where the maximum snow load is 2 kPa; areas above specific\naltitudes in these areas require specific design.\n\nProjections such as gutters, flashings and chimneys need additional fixings and detailing to resist loads from\nsliding snow. It is normal to fit snow straps to residential gutters in snow prone areas.\n3.6.2.3\nRoof Weight\nThe self-weight of light-weight profiled sheet cladding should be included in the calculation of net wind load, but\nis a minor factor and, typically, works in the opposite direction to wind loads.\n3.6.2.2A Snow Loadings Map\nAuckland\nTaupo\nTurangi\nNew Plymouth\nOpotiki\nWellington\nNelson\nWestport\nGreymouth\nOmarama\nDunedin\nAlexandra\nChristchurch\nCheviot\nMilford\nSound\n3.6.2.2B Altitudes for Snow\nLoading Design\nMaximum Altitude as per NZS 3604\nZone Up to:\n1.0 kPa\n1.5 kPa\n2.0kPa\n\nNot Required\nModes of Failure\nServiceability limit is a state when a building, or any part of it, becomes unfit for its intended use due to\ndeformation or deflection.\nUltimate limit is a state associated with collapse or failure, or when a building or any part of it becomes unstable\nor unsafe.\n3.7.1\nServiceability and Ultimate Failure\nInitial failure under wind uplift for pierce-fastened cladding is usually by local buckling of the rib crest adjacent to\nthe fastener. While the cladding can still resist a load, this permanent deformation is liable to cause leakage at\nthat point; therefore, it is a serviceability failure and is often the limit state for trapezoidal profiles. Medium and\nhigh rib trapezoidals may have ultimate loads as the determining factor.\nFailure under wind load for clip-fastened cladding is usually by the clips de-indexing and the cladding sheets\nblowing off. This is an ultimate failure.\nIf a standard corrugate or low rib trapezoidal product passes UDL for serviceability it will comfortably exceed\nultimate design load requirements. For medium and high ribbed trapezoidal, both serviceability and strength loads\nshould be checked. Clip-fastened products are typically restricted by strength load only.\nPoint load resistance should also be checked against the expected roof traffic load of the finished structure.\n(See 3.7.4 Roof Traffic)\n3.7.2\nDeflection\nDeflection is the temporary bending of roof or wall cladding that occurs under load when the material is subjected\nto forces within its elastic limits.\nDeflection under distributed load is a voluntary limit of wall cladding, deformation causing residual deflection\nafter application of point load is a serviceability failure of roofing.\nTemporary deflection under load is not considered for roof load tables as it has not been found to affect\nweathertightness. Temporary deflection under load of wall cladding is a recommended limitation for aesthetic\nreasons, but it is not mandatory.\n3.7.3\nDeformation\nDeformation is a permanent alteration to the profile's shape that occurs when the material is taken beyond its\nelastic limits. This is most often seen as deformation under the fastener head after high outwards loads, or\nbuckling of the rib after the imposition of a point load\n\nWith high-strength claddings buckling failure is often quite sudden and severe once the point of yield is reached,\nwhile progressive deflection under repeated loads within the material's elastic limit is minimal.\nLow-strength (G300) steel or non-ferrous metals can progressively yield under repeated heavy foot traffic, and are\nmore prone to point load damage. This should be considered at the design stage. Machine roll-curved, crimp-\ncurved cladding, and metal roof tiles are usually made from low-strength steels.\nIt is not acceptable for G300 steel to be substituted for G550 steel in products that are traditionally run from high-\ntensile strength material.\n3.7.4\nRoof Traffic\nThe designer must consider the degree and type of foot traffic that may be expected on a roof. The following\nrequirements are subjective standards and must be considered in line with customer expectations, and building\nuse and type.\nMore robust design than specified below (reducing purlin spacing or adding protection from mechanical\naction), is required for roofs that are regularly accessed, roofs used as staging by subsequent trades, or\nareas that are adjacent to access points, particularly step down access.\nType A - Unrestricted Access\nType A are roofs:\nthat need to be regularly traversed by the roofer for access during installation;\nthat will be accessed regularly by sub-trades;\nthat butt on to walls or windows that may require maintenance;\n3.7.3A Deformation Around a Fastener\nHead\n3.7.3B Permanent Damage Around\nFastener Head\n\nthat have plant, chimneys, or solar installations requiring regular maintenance; or\nthat require regular access for clearing gutters or spouting of debris.\nFor Type A roofs, the cladding must resist the load of 1.1 kN applied to the pan or a single rib, and a\nstrength load of 2 kPa applied to the weakest point.\nType B - Restricted Access\nType B are roofs:\nthat are simple in design and do not have to be regularly traversed by the installer;\nwhich are infrequently accessed by qualified trades people for maintenance; or\nwith a pitch of more than 35 deg .\nFor Type B, roofs the cladding must resist the load of 1.1 kN applied to the pan or over two ribs and a 2\nkPa load applied to the weakest point.\nType C - Non-Trafficable\nType C are roofs:\nwhere supports are required to be laid to support roof traffic, or traffic should take place within 300\nmm of purlin lines,\nwhich have a pitch of 60 deg or greater; and\nincluding non-trafficable translucent roof sheeting.\nFor Type C roofs, the cladding must resist the minimum load of 0.5 kN applied to the pan or over two\nribs.\n3.7.5\nDead Loads\nAny permanent load added to the roof cladding or structure is termed imposed; that includes air-conditioning\nequipment, solar installations, television aerials, anchor points, and walkways.\nAll loads must be supported on the rib of the profile or through the profile to the primary structure. Any\nattachment to the roof cladding must be compatible with the cladding, or isolated from it.\n\n3.7.5A Correctly Installed Permanent Load\nAn air conditioning unit correctly installed on a roof, using durable and compatible materials.\nNo additional equipment must be directly connected to the cladding without considering the effect of\nincreased dead and live loads.\nWhen designing installations for placement on the roof, the roof traffic implications of installing and\nservicing such must be considered when determining point load resistance requirements.\n3.7.6\nConstruction Loads\nConstruction loads on a building include the wind load on a partially clad or braced roof or building. Depending on\nthe method and sequence of construction, it can be greater than the load on a completed building. Construction\nloads also include temporary localised loads from material storage, scaffolding, and tradespeople.\nOther forces contributing to construction load include:\nThe intensity of internal wind pressures due to a temporary absence of ceilings, walls and glazing.\nStorage of roof cladding on the structure. Bundles of roof cladding should be placed so they do not cause\noverstress in purlins.\nAny scaffolding above an existing roof must be designed to avoid damage to the roof structure or coatings,\nand be designed or sequenced to avoid wet storage corrosion. It is far better practice to stage jobs so that\nlower roofs are not used as a working platform for work on higher levels\nFatigue and Brittle Failure\nAll metals may be subjected to fatigue under repeated heavy load conditions.\nWhile high-strength steel is susceptible to fatigue, this seldom happens in practice. Aluminium brackets and clips\nhave been known to fail by fatigue and this should be considered in designing such items.\nOther metals, such as lead and copper, are restricted in length or overall panel size to avoid cracking by fatigue.\nSharply folded corners should be avoided on these materials and the minimum radii requirements should be\nfollowed.\nHydrogen embrittlement can occur when folded items such as external gutter brackets are subjected to post-\nforming hot dip galvanizing. This can be avoided by forming to radii appropriate to the material grade and\nthickness being formed.\n3.7.6A Typical Rib Damage Due to\nPoint Load\n3.7.6B Severe Damage Causing Splitting\nFasteners\nMost fastener failures happen due to negative load (or uplift) resulting in pull out of the screw from the support,\nor the screw pulling through the cladding or causing permanent deformation. Testing procedures are designed to\nclosely simulate these conditions.\nProduct testing does not include pull-out of the screw, this should be checked independently.\n3.8.1\nFastener Loads\nFastener failure by fatigue can occur when fasteners embedded in timber or hot rolled steel, are subject to\nfrequent bending action by repeated thermal expansion forces. This is unlikely to happen to cold rolled steel\npurlins up to 2.5 mm in thickness as the thinner depth of connection of the screw into the purlin allows it to\nrotate, rather than bend.\n3.8.1A Fasteners - Mechanical Properties\nA\nB\nC\nA. Single Shear Strength (N)\nThe shear load required to break the screw\nB. Axial Tensile Strength (N)\nThe tensile strength to break the screw\nC. Torsional Strength (Nm)\nThe torque required to break the screw\n3.8.2\nSteel Purlins\nA fastener penetration of three threads through the steel member is sufficient for the fastener to meet its full\ndesign capacity. Pull-out failure of screws must be checked when assessing a profile's load/span capacity.\n\nThe pull-out values of screws into light gauge steel battens or purlins varies greatly with thread design, pitch, and\ndrill point shape. When fastening into light gauge steel, the pull-out values of the specified screw must be\nconsidered, and the installation must be completed with that type, gauge, and brand of screw. In light gauge steel\nunder 1mm in thickness, it is also important to avoid stripping out the formed screw thread\n3.8.3\nTimber Purlins\nTimber purlins generally require a fastener penetration of 30 mm. With this level of embedment, a screw equipped\nwith a profiled washer though 0.55 material will fail by pull-through of the cladding before it fails by fastener\nwithdrawal from the timber. Greater thicknesses of cladding may require specific design. For fastening into\nsarking or rigid air barrier less than 30 mm thick, the pull-out values for the specific screw and sarking material\nshould be obtained from the supplier and required fastener pattern calculated.\n3.8.4\nPull-over Values\nPull-over values for medium and high rib trapezoidal profiles must be checked against strength\nloads provided by testing.\nPull-over load depends on the head or washer size. For example, as 12# and 14# screw heads have\napproximately the same diameter, these screw sizes have the same design load value for pull-over.\nIf the pullover load is likely to be exceeded, the options are to increase the metal thickness or use a\nload-spreading washer.\n3.8.5\nLoad-spreading Washers\nProfiled load-spreading washers spread high wind uplift-loads over a larger area around the fastener head. Using\nload spreading washers under the fastener can increase the load resistance of each fastener by up to 50%.\nThe type, size and stiffness of washers are critical for performance. Where performance data incorporating load-\nspreading washers is used, the specification of the washer must be quoted with the fastener.\nIn general, load-spreading washers should have a minimum thickness of 0.95 mm for steel and 1.2 mm for non-\nferrous metal.\n\n3.8.5A Load Spreading Washers\nLoad\nSpreading\nWasher\nPlan View\nWhere oversized holes are used to accommodate thermal movement of the sheeting, load-spreading washers\nshould be used with sealing washers to ensure weather tightness.\nFastener Requirements and Overhangs\n3.9.1\nPurlin-Rafter Connections\nFor sprung curved roofs, the purlin/rafter connection must be increased at the eaves.\nLong lengths of pierce fixed roofing will impose added loads to the purlin connection due to thermal movement\nof the roof.\n3.9.1A Purlin to rafter fastener requirements for SG8 Radiata pine, complying\nwith NZS 3604:2011\nUse 70 x 45 mm radiata pine on flat\nminimum\nUse 90 x 45 mm radiata pine on flat\nminimum\nRafter\nSpacing\nPurlin\nSpacing\nLow Wind\nZone\nMedium Wind\nZone\nHigh Wind\nZone\nVery High\nWind Zone\nExtra High\nWind Zone\n0.9\n0.6\nA\nB\nC\nC\nC\n0.9\n0.9\nB\nC\nC\nC\nD\n0.9\n1.2\nC\nC\nC\nD\nD\n1.2\n0.6\nB\nC\nC\nC\nC\n1.2\n0.9\nC\nC\nC\nD\nD\n1.2\n1.2\nC\nC\nD\nN/A\nN/A\n3.9.1B Purlin to Rafter Fastener Fixing Capacity\nType\nFastener\nFixing Capacity (kN)\nA\n1/90 x 3.15 gun nails\n0.55\nB\n2/90 x 3.15 gun nails\n0.80\nC\n1/10g x 80 mm self-drilling screw\n2.40\nD\n2.10g x 80 mm self-drlling screws\n3.45\nE\n1/14 g X 100 mm self-driling screws\n5.50\n3.9.2\nSheet Overhang\nThe maximum overhang for all corrugate and low trapezoidal profiles is 150 mm, unless a product has been\nspecifically tested to withstand point load and design wind loads at a greater overhang.\nThe allowable overhang distance of various cladding profiles will depend on their section properties.\nWhen using trapezoidal profiles, greater overhangs can be achieved by stiffening the edge of the\n\nsheet in various ways; the most common being using a square gutter with a horizontal flange, but\nthis should be fastened on every pan to achieve continuity.\nThe limit placed on low trapezoidal profiles with a stiffened overhang is 300 mm but it is not suitable for\ncorrugate.\nThe overhang distance can be increased for some trapezoidal profiles with a rib height greater than 28 mm, but\nthis distance must be proved by testing.\nWhere the cladding is fixed at a ridge or apron, the overhang distance can be increased to 250 mm from the end of\nthe sheet, as the cladding is not subjected to the same point load or UDL and the load is shared with the flashing.\nPoint of access and expected roof traffic loads must also be considered.\n3.9.3\nFastener Patterns\nFastening patterns for the most commonly used profiles are designated in the following manner.\n3.9.3A Corrugate Fastening Patterns\nC5\nC4\nC3\nC2\nHit 1 Miss 1\nHit 1 Miss 2 Miss 1\nHit 1 Miss 2 Miss 3\nHit 1 Miss 4\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nNext Sheet Overlaps\n3.9.3B Fixing Patterns for 5 Rib Sheeting\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nNext Sheet Overlaps\n5T4\n5T3\n5T2\nHit All\nHit 2 Miss 1 Hit 1\nHit 1 Miss 1\n\n3.9.3C Fixing Patterns for 6 Rib Sheeting\n6T5\n6T3\nHit All\nHit 2 Miss 2 Hit 1\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nNext Sheet Overlaps\nThese fastening patterns should be used in conjunction with load span graphs.\nThe load on a purlin and a purlin/rafter connection is determined by the wind load and the area of roof the load is\nacting upon.

The number of corrugations also changed from 8 to 10.5, which enabled\nthe sheets to be laid either side up, as opposed to over-and-under.\nThe standard corrugation profile has 17.5 mm deep crests at 76 mm spacings, but smaller and deeper alternatives\nare also available.\nCorrugate cladding is formed with a slightly asymmetrical overlap profile to a capillary barrier.\n3.4.2\nTrapezoidal Profile\nThe trapezoidal shape provides greater water carrying capacity and provides greater spanning capabilities than\ncorrugate profile.\n\nThe angle and height of the trapezoid rib determines the profiles performance under compression. A deeper rib\ngenerally gives improved performance, but lowers the effective coverage of the sheet.\nTrapezoidal profiles are available with different ribs heights (see 3.4A Pierce Fastened Profiles).\n3.4.3\nMiniature Profiles\nVarious miniature cladding profiles are manufactured in New Zealand, the most common being known variously\nunder the names of mini-corrugate, sparrow iron, baby iron and mini-iron.\nMini-corrugate is sometimes used for small roof areas, such as spires and awnings. It is most commonly used\nfor wall cladding, parapets and internal linings where studs are normally spaced at 600 mm centres or less.\nSome miniature trapezoidal profiles are also manufactured specifically for wall cladding.\n3.4.4\nSecret-fixed Profiles\n3.4.4A Secret-fixed Profiles\nTrough Profile - Minimum Depth 38mm\nTray may be profiled\nStanding Seam/Tray Profile -\nMinimum Depth 25 mm\nSecret fixed profiles are attached to the structure by clips rather than by pierce fasteners. This allows for freer\nthermal movement and minimises the number of penetrations in the cladding. The steep sided ribs and wide pans\ntypical of secret fixed profiles gives greater water carrying capacity, and facilitates watertight flashing design.\nTraditionally they were used for pitches as low as 1 deg but due to durability issues caused by deflection and\nresultant ponding the recommended minimum pitch is now 3 deg .\nTrough sections generally have 2 to 3 pans or trays 180 - 250 mm in width. Tray roofing has a single pan of up to\n550 mm in width.\nStanding Seam is a subset of tray roofing. Standing seam roofs are based on traditional manufacturing methods\n(using folding and hand tool rather than roll forming), but now they are available roll-formed in most itirations.\n(See 15.4 Tray Roofing)\n3.4.5\nMaterial Grade\n\nTo test for tensile strength the material is subjected to a longitudinal (stretching) load, and values are taken for\nyield strength (when it permanently deforms) and tensile strength (when it breaks). Elongation is also measured\nduring this test.\nThe minimum tensile strength defines the grade of steel, eg, G550 for high-strength light gauge steel, but to\ncomply with this grade the yield strength and elongation must also fall within defined parameters.\nYield strength is an important determinant of the strength of a profile, along with profile shape and material\nthickness. High tensile material will have more resistance to failure such as buckling around the fastener under\nwind uplift, pull-through of the fastener head, or buckling under foot traffic load. However, tensile strength has a\nnegligible effect on deflection under load.\nWhere 0.55 material is specified for straight corrugate or trapezoidal roofing, it is unacceptable to substitute\nG300 for G550 grade material as the resultant profile will have little strength advantage over 0.40 mm G550.\nAluminium is defined by a hardness grade ranging from H32 to H38. Typically, H34 is used for flashings, severe\nprofiles such as trough sections, and profiles that are to be curved. Most corrugated and Trapezoidal profiles are\nmanufactured using H36.\nIt must be remembered that the alloy also affects strength. H36 aluminium in 5005 or 5025 alloys, which are\ntypically used in New Zealand, will have considerably greater tensile strength than the same grade in a 3000-\nseries alloy.\n3.4.5A End Use for Typical Alloys\nMaterial\nGradeTypical End Use\nSteel\nG300 Flashings, ridging, spouting, curving, some trough sections.\nG550 Corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, some trough sections.\nAluminium 5505/5025H32\nLock seaming\nH34\nFlashings, curved roofing, trough sections, and tray roofing.\nH 36 Flashings and profiled roofing, trapezoidal sections, and corrugate.\n\n3.4.5B Tensile Testing\n\n3.4.5C Typical Result for G550 Steel\n3.4.6\nMaterial Thickness\nMaterial thickness has a great bearing on load capacity and buckling resistance. For residential buildings, 0.40\nmm thickness material is most commonly used for corrugated and trapezoidal profiles, and this will normally be\nsufficient to withstand the statutory wind loads at typical spans and fastener spacings in up to High Wind\n\nZones. In higher wind speeds, it is often more effective to use 0.55 mm material, rather than reducing purlin and\nfastener spacings.\nMaterial with a 0.40 mm thickness is very vulnerable to foot traffic damage in most profile configurations and\nrequires careful and accurate foot placement to avoid buckling. In residential buildings with high foot traffic\nexpectancy or highly visible roofs, eg, multi-level mono-pitch roofs, roofs with UV collectors, flues, aircon\ndevices, chimneys that need servicing, or prestige housing 0.55 mm material should be selected.\nFor commercial and industrial applications, 0.55 mm is almost universally used on the roof, and 0.40 mm is most\ncommon on walls.\nIn addition to 0.40 mm and 0.55 mm, 0.48 mm G550 steel is often used for high tensile trough sections, which will\noften compare in strength to similar profiles manufactured from 0.55 mm G300 material. Most roofing profiles\ncan also be manufactured from 0.75 mm G550 material where greater robustness and resistance to foot traffic\nare desired.\nMaterial is available with other thicknesses; for example, 0.63 mm material is often manufactured for the Pacific\nislands, and 0.35 mm is sometimes used to manufacture specialist wall cladding.","pdfPages":[56,57,58,59,60,61],"subsections":[{"number":"3.4A","title":"Pierce Fastened Profiles","level":3,"content":"3.4\nProfiles\nProfile familes can broadly be segregated as pierce fastened (corrugate, trapezoidal), and secret fix (tray and\ntrough).

The most severe wind load is usually an\nuplift load, or negative (-), and snow load is a downward load or positive (+).\n3.6.2.1\nWind Load\nThe wind load imposed on a roof structure is taken to apply at right angles to the roof cladding over a nominated\narea. The design wind load is affected by the design of the building and is modified using factors called pressure\ncoefficients.

Therefore, outwards load is the more critical figure.\nEngineers calculate both the serviceability load and the ultimate load. They compare these values with the\nmaximum failure loads of the products and systems they are considering.\nLoad/span data for standard corrugate, and low rib 5 and 6 ribbed trapezoidals is at the end of this section.\n3.6.2.1B Load/Span Data clauses\nDesign\nSteel\nAluminium\nNZS\n3604\n3.10.1 G550 Steel Roof Fastening Pattern\nTables\n3.10.3 Aluminium Fastening Pattern Tables\nSED\n3.11.2 Steel Cladding Wind Load Span\nGraphs\n3.11.3 Aluminium Cladding Wind Load Span\nGraphs\nRefer to manufacturer's load/span tables for all other profiles, which should give the maximum recommended\nload for continuous spans when tested as described in 17.1.3 Testing Procedure.\n\n3.6.2.1C Sheltered by Trees, \"Urban Terrain\"\nScattered obstructions of a similar height or lower within 500 m from a building will considerably lessen wind\nspeeds and lower design wind pressures.\n3.6.2.1D Surrounded by flat ground, \"Open Terrain\"\nStructures in open land such as flat pasture and playing fields, or by water, will be subjected to higher design\nwind pressures.\n3.6.2.1E Topographical Influences\nTerrain also has a big effect. Structures near the crest of a rise or on flat land near a steep face will have increased\ndesign wind pressure.\nWind Design Load is affected by building design factors such as building height, shape, proportions, orientation,\nand roof pitch. Permeability can also be a big factor; buildings with large openings on one side but completely\nclosed on the other three sides will suffer high internal wind pressures. These internal pressures must be added\nto the suction load on the outside of the roof when calculating wind design load.\nLocal territorial authorities are usually able to give wind speed figures for a specific address in their area. All\nother factors, including topographical influences, internal, and local pressure factors must be considered by a\nsuitably qualified professional to calculate the design wind load on a structure.\nLocal Pressure Factor (Kl)\nThe local pressure factor (Kl) is an important design consideration required by the Loadings Standard. The\nperipheral areas of roof and wall surfaces are subjected to greater uplift loads than the main body of the roof.\nDesigners need to include local pressure factors in the calculation of wind loads on the cladding.\nWhen determining fixing requirements to NZS 1170.2, the engineer should prepare a roof map showing purlin\nspans and local pressure factors for each section of the cladding.\nWhen designing to NZS 1170 the local pressure factors are:\n1.5-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.2 or 20% of the width or height of the\nbuilding whichever is the least.\n2.0-applied to the edges of all buildings at a dimension equal to 0.1 or 10% of the width or height whichever is\nthe least.\n3.0-applied to roof pitches less than 10 deg , at the corners where the dimensions in (a) intersect.

However, to get a true\ndesign wind speed is a lot more complex; various factors have to be applied including roof self-weight, internal\npressure and local pressure coefficients.\nThe most influential of these factors is generally the local pressure factor, but internal pressure can also have a\nprofound influence-particularly on unlined structures.\n3.6.2.2\nSnow Loads\nRoof cladding design does not usually have to be altered for snow load, maximum snow load in New Zealand\n(under NZS 3604) is a UDL of 2 kPa.This is less than the upwards load in a Very High Wind Zone, however, as it is\na downwards load, restraint is linear by the purlins, rather than point restraint by the fasteners, so greater capacity\nis achieved.\nAny profile-gauge combination that will resist a wind load of Very High or Extra High Wind Zone with fasteners at\neach crest, will adequately resist a 2 kPa snow load. It may, however, be neccessary to increase the strength of\nthe structure to allow for induced snow loads.\nNZS 3604 divides New Zealand into six zones where the maximum snow load is 2 kPa; areas above specific\naltitudes in these areas require specific design.\n\nProjections such as gutters, flashings and chimneys need additional fixings and detailing to resist loads from\nsliding snow. It is normal to fit snow straps to residential gutters in snow prone areas.\n3.6.2.3\nRoof Weight\nThe self-weight of light-weight profiled sheet cladding should be included in the calculation of net wind load, but\nis a minor factor and, typically, works in the opposite direction to wind loads.\n3.6.2.2A Snow Loadings Map\nAuckland\nTaupo\nTurangi\nNew Plymouth\nOpotiki\nWellington\nNelson\nWestport\nGreymouth\nOmarama\nDunedin\nAlexandra\nChristchurch\nCheviot\nMilford\nSound\n3.6.2.2B Altitudes for Snow\nLoading Design\nMaximum Altitude as per NZS 3604\nZone Up to:\n1.0 kPa\n1.5 kPa\n2.0kPa\n\nNot Required","pdfPages":[65,66,67,68,69,70,71],"subsections":[{"number":"3.6.1","title":"Point Load","level":3,"content":"3.6\nTypes of Load\nLoads acting on roof cladding are generally classified into two types: point load and uniformly distributed Load\n(UDL)\nCladding reacts differently to a point load and a UDL.

While the cladding can still resist a load, this permanent deformation is liable to cause leakage at\nthat point; therefore, it is a serviceability failure and is often the limit state for trapezoidal profiles. Medium and\nhigh rib trapezoidals may have ultimate loads as the determining factor.\nFailure under wind load for clip-fastened cladding is usually by the clips de-indexing and the cladding sheets\nblowing off. This is an ultimate failure.\nIf a standard corrugate or low rib trapezoidal product passes UDL for serviceability it will comfortably exceed\nultimate design load requirements. For medium and high ribbed trapezoidal, both serviceability and strength loads\nshould be checked. Clip-fastened products are typically restricted by strength load only.\nPoint load resistance should also be checked against the expected roof traffic load of the finished structure.\n(See 3.7.4 Roof Traffic)\n3.7.2\nDeflection\nDeflection is the temporary bending of roof or wall cladding that occurs under load when the material is subjected\nto forces within its elastic limits.\nDeflection under distributed load is a voluntary limit of wall cladding, deformation causing residual deflection\nafter application of point load is a serviceability failure of roofing.\nTemporary deflection under load is not considered for roof load tables as it has not been found to affect\nweathertightness. Temporary deflection under load of wall cladding is a recommended limitation for aesthetic\nreasons, but it is not mandatory.\n3.7.3\nDeformation\nDeformation is a permanent alteration to the profile's shape that occurs when the material is taken beyond its\nelastic limits. This is most often seen as deformation under the fastener head after high outwards loads, or\nbuckling of the rib after the imposition of a point load\n\nWith high-strength claddings buckling failure is often quite sudden and severe once the point of yield is reached,\nwhile progressive deflection under repeated loads within the material's elastic limit is minimal.\nLow-strength (G300) steel or non-ferrous metals can progressively yield under repeated heavy foot traffic, and are\nmore prone to point load damage. This should be considered at the design stage. Machine roll-curved, crimp-\ncurved cladding, and metal roof tiles are usually made from low-strength steels.\nIt is not acceptable for G300 steel to be substituted for G550 steel in products that are traditionally run from high-\ntensile strength material.\n3.7.4\nRoof Traffic\nThe designer must consider the degree and type of foot traffic that may be expected on a roof. The following\nrequirements are subjective standards and must be considered in line with customer expectations, and building\nuse and type.\nMore robust design than specified below (reducing purlin spacing or adding protection from mechanical\naction), is required for roofs that are regularly accessed, roofs used as staging by subsequent trades, or\nareas that are adjacent to access points, particularly step down access.\nType A - Unrestricted Access\nType A are roofs:\nthat need to be regularly traversed by the roofer for access during installation;\nthat will be accessed regularly by sub-trades;\nthat butt on to walls or windows that may require maintenance;\n3.7.3A Deformation Around a Fastener\nHead\n3.7.3B Permanent Damage Around\nFastener Head\n\nthat have plant, chimneys, or solar installations requiring regular maintenance; or\nthat require regular access for clearing gutters or spouting of debris.\nFor Type A roofs, the cladding must resist the load of 1.1 kN applied to the pan or a single rib, and a\nstrength load of 2 kPa applied to the weakest point.\nType B - Restricted Access\nType B are roofs:\nthat are simple in design and do not have to be regularly traversed by the installer;\nwhich are infrequently accessed by qualified trades people for maintenance; or\nwith a pitch of more than 35 deg .\nFor Type B, roofs the cladding must resist the load of 1.1 kN applied to the pan or over two ribs and a 2\nkPa load applied to the weakest point.\nType C - Non-Trafficable\nType C are roofs:\nwhere supports are required to be laid to support roof traffic, or traffic should take place within 300\nmm of purlin lines,\nwhich have a pitch of 60 deg or greater; and\nincluding non-trafficable translucent roof sheeting.\nFor Type C roofs, the cladding must resist the minimum load of 0.5 kN applied to the pan or over two\nribs.\n3.7.5\nDead Loads\nAny permanent load added to the roof cladding or structure is termed imposed; that includes air-conditioning\nequipment, solar installations, television aerials, anchor points, and walkways.\nAll loads must be supported on the rib of the profile or through the profile to the primary structure. Any\nattachment to the roof cladding must be compatible with the cladding, or isolated from it.\n\n3.7.5A Correctly Installed Permanent Load\nAn air conditioning unit correctly installed on a roof, using durable and compatible materials.\nNo additional equipment must be directly connected to the cladding without considering the effect of\nincreased dead and live loads.\nWhen designing installations for placement on the roof, the roof traffic implications of installing and\nservicing such must be considered when determining point load resistance requirements.\n3.7.6\nConstruction Loads\nConstruction loads on a building include the wind load on a partially clad or braced roof or building. Depending on\nthe method and sequence of construction, it can be greater than the load on a completed building. Construction\nloads also include temporary localised loads from material storage, scaffolding, and tradespeople.\nOther forces contributing to construction load include:\nThe intensity of internal wind pressures due to a temporary absence of ceilings, walls and glazing.\nStorage of roof cladding on the structure. Bundles of roof cladding should be placed so they do not cause\noverstress in purlins.\nAny scaffolding above an existing roof must be designed to avoid damage to the roof structure or coatings,\nand be designed or sequenced to avoid wet storage corrosion. It is far better practice to stage jobs so that\nlower roofs are not used as a working platform for work on higher levels\nFatigue and Brittle Failure\nAll metals may be subjected to fatigue under repeated heavy load conditions.\nWhile high-strength steel is susceptible to fatigue, this seldom happens in practice. Aluminium brackets and clips\nhave been known to fail by fatigue and this should be considered in designing such items.\nOther metals, such as lead and copper, are restricted in length or overall panel size to avoid cracking by fatigue.\nSharply folded corners should be avoided on these materials and the minimum radii requirements should be\nfollowed.\nHydrogen embrittlement can occur when folded items such as external gutter brackets are subjected to post-\nforming hot dip galvanizing. This can be avoided by forming to radii appropriate to the material grade and\nthickness being formed.\n3.7.6A Typical Rib Damage Due to\nPoint Load\n3.7.6B Severe Damage Causing Splitting","pdfPages":[72,73,74,75,76],"subsections":[{"number":"3.7.1","title":"Serviceability and Ultimate Failure","level":3,"content":"3.7\nModes of Failure\nServiceability limit is a state when a building, or any part of it, becomes unfit for its intended use due to\ndeformation or deflection.\nUltimate limit is a state associated with collapse or failure, or when a building or any part of it becomes unstable\nor unsafe.\n3.7.1\nServiceability and Ultimate Failure\nInitial failure under wind uplift for pierce-fastened cladding is usually by local buckling of the rib crest adjacent to\nthe fastener.

They should be read in conjunction with the point load limitations appropriate to\nthe degree of traffic predicted on the roof.\n3.11.1\nFastener Pull-out\nNZMRM wind uplift resistance testing specifically assumes fasteners are permanently fixed to the purlins and will\nnot pull out. Because of this and, also due to the huge range of fastener/purlin material variations, the pull-out\nresistance of fasteners is eliminated from the uplift testing procedure.
