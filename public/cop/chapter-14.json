See 4 Durability.\nAluminium requires special installation details to achieve durability. See 14.19 Fixing Aluminium\nSheeting for more details.\n14.2.1 \nMeasuring \nMeasuring should take place once sufficient structure is in place to enable accurate calculation of lengths\nrequired. It is beneficial to make more than one measurement of any run to identify discrepancies and avoid\nerrors.\n14.2.2 \nOrdering \nCladding materials should be ordered with enough time to allow for manufacture and transport. Profile, thickness,\ncolour, grade, and any requirements for labelling of bundles should all be clearly identified.\nDo not mix products; different manufacturers use different paint formulations. Where different brands of pre-\npainted material are used on the same building, differences in colour, gloss, and weathering performance may\nappear immediately or over time.\n14.2.3 \nTransportation \nLoad safety and protection is primarily the driver's responsibility.\nShort sheets should be packed on top of longer ones, which should have end and edge protection to avoid cut-\nend damage to the sheets below them. Dunnage should be evenly spaced in vertical alignment. Bundles must be\nplaced and secured to protect against damage from other materials.\nFor sheets that are exposed on the underside in situ, such as for unlined wall cladding applications, or have\ndouble-sided or fleece-lined coatings, protection must be given to prevent the dunnage from damaging the bottom\nsheet. This is normally achieved by the application of a short slip sheet with paper overlay.\n14.2.3A Slip sheet with Paper Overlay\nRoof Bundle\nBearer\nSlip sheet\nPaper\n 14 \n 14.2 PRODUCT SELECTION\n 2 \n 14 \n 14.2 \n375\nThis is a controlled document.

If there is any concern\nabout the condition of the product, the supplier should be contacted before installation commences.\nEnsure all components needed to complete the installation, including fasteners and accessories, are onsite\nbefore commencing installation.\n14.3.1 \nUnloading \nSet out a flat area and supporting dunnage to ensure sheets will not be damaged by site debris.\nWhen unloading by crane, ensure the lifting boom has a spreader bar and that tightening strops do not damage\nsheet laps. Slings or strops should be nylon with leather sleeves to prevent fraying or cutting and\ndamaging slings. Single slings and chains should not be used to lift packs of cladding.\n14.3.1A Sling with Spreader Bar\nSpreader\nWhen unloading by hand, lift each sheet off the stack without sliding over under sheets, as that may cause\ndamage to the paint.\nThe person receiving the roof is responsible for identifying a safe and convenient landing point for the load, in\nassociation with the main contractor. The mobile or truck mounted crane operator has the duty of declining any\nloading instruction which he deems unsafe. Under no conditions should the load be traversed directly above any\nperson\nBundles or packs of roof cladding must remain banded when being lifted by a crane.\nThey must be placed adjacent to the portal frame and not mid-span on the purlins. Bundles must be\nplaced so that their weight is spread over the entire area of the roof and should be positioned with the\nlaps in the direction of laying.\nWorkers receiving a bundle of roof cladding on the roof must have sufficient mobility to avoid the load,\nand use tag lines to control the swinging of the load while it is out of reach.\n 14 \n 14.3 ACCEPTING DELIVERY\n 3 \n 14 \n 14.3 \n377\nThis is a controlled document.

This happens because the metal exposed\nto moisture without air forms bulky, unstable, and loosely adherent, hygroscopic compounds. See 4.10.7\nCrevice Corrosion/Wet Storage Stain.\nWater can infiltrate deeply into a bundle of close-stacked sheets. The extent and severity of wet storage stain is\nusually proportional to the time the sheeting has been wet, however, the time to onset can be very variable, and\noccur more rapidly in warm conditions. \nSheets can be dried by filleting sheets or cross-stacking them on a slope to allow water to drain and air to\ncirculate between them. Only use a dry, well-ventilated environment for long-term storage.\nA patchy visual appearance of the paint can also result from wet stack storage of pre-painted steel products. This\nis known as blooming.\nBlooming results from water swelling the paint and flattening or suppressing gloss components. The gloss\ndistortion is typically temporary and will dissipate with time, and exposure to heat/sunlight. This can be\ndemonstrated by the application of boiling water to an affected surface bringing the appearance back to normal\n 14 \n 14.3 ACCEPTING DELIVERY\n 3 \n 14 \n 14.3 \n378\nThis is a controlled document.

The information must indicate the positions on the sheet where persons may\nsafely walk or stand without causing damage or, alternatively, indicate the necessity to provide\ntemporary walkways.\nFor roofs tested in accordance with MRM testing standards, see 17.1 Metal Cladding Testing. A Restricted\nAccess roof will withstand a 100 kg point load applied to the rib or over two pans, and an Unrestricted Access\nroof will withstand a 100 kg point load to a single rib at mid span. It must be taken into account that a worker\nladen with tools may weigh more than 100 kg, and impact loads can also contribute to exceeding this limit.\nWhen access to the roof is necessary after construction, it is best practice to step in the pan of the profile\nwhen walking up the roof, and follow purlin lines when traversing roofs.\n14.5A Walking in the Pan\nIf the ribs are too close together, so workers cannot place their feet in the pan, their weight must be\nspread evenly over at least two ribs when walking up the roof.\n14.5B Spreading Weight over two Ribs\n 14 \n 14.5 WALKING ON ROOFS\n 5 \n 14 \n 14.5 \n381\nThis is a controlled document.

Avoid the closely ribbed type which will carry swarf and other objects.\n 14 \n 14.5 WALKING ON ROOFS\n 5 \n 14 \n 14.5 \n382\nThis is a controlled document.

It is not designed to protect against corrosion, humidity, or chemicals.\nStrippable film must be removed before prolonged exposure to sunlight, as that may make it extremely difficult to\nremove. Prolonged exposure and wet conditions can also cause the film adhesive to whiten and breakdown,\nleaving residue on the painted surface when the film is removed. Once removed from the sheet for installation,\nstrippable film must be collected and removed from the site.\n14.6.1 \nStoring Product with Strippable Film \nProduct with film applied must be stored at temperatures of less than 50 deg C and out of direct sunlight to avoid\nprolonged UV exposure.\nThe product needs to be kept dry to prevent moisture ingress between the film and the painted surface. In the\nlong term moisture ingress may cause issues to the painted surface; and in the shorter term cause the film\nadhesive to whiten and breakdown, leaving residue on the painted surface when the film is removed.\n 14 \n 14.6 STRIPPABLE FILMS\n 6 \n 14 \n 14.6 \n383\nThis is a controlled document.

If the\nremaining area of a roof or wall section to be covered is less than a standard sheet width, the sheet should be cut\nlengthwise to fit the gap.\nSimilarly, when replacing a roof without removing existing flashings, for example, apron or chimney flashings\nbehind cladding, the area of the retained flashing should be reduced by cutting back to the minimum practically\nachievable.\nIf a roof sheet lap requires extra protection, for instance, when over the apex of a barrel curved roof where pitch is\nless than the minimum stipulated for the product, laps should be sealed rather than double-lapped. Lap tape is\npreferred over gunned sealant for this purpose, as it is less likely to become displaced while positioning the\nsheet.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BDL01 Double Lapping Roofing Sheets\nExtract:\n\"...The side laps of roofing sheets are designed to allow enough drying and air access to prevent wet\nstorage damage. Double lapping often results in this function being compromised to the point that\ncorrosion forms between the two surfaces... \"\n 14 \n 14.7 DOUBLE LAPPING\n 7 \n 14 \n 14.7 \n384\nThis is a controlled document.

It is not\nnecessary to face laps away from prevailing wind direction as roofs must be designed to withstand weather from\nany quarter. On critical jobs or when using curved sheets, it is advisable that side laps face away from the line of\nsight.\nSheets should be laid square to the nearest architectural feature, and regularly checked to correct any\nmisalignment of sheet or squareness of structure. Laying out of square will result in saw-toothing of the eaves\nline. Saw-toothing of greater than 5 mm may be trimmed back to form a straight line.\n 14 \n 14.8 SETTING OUT\n 8 \n 14 \n 14.8 \n385\nThis is a controlled document.

The\ncarbon in the pencil promotes corrosion, which will etch the surface of the material, leaving a permanent mark.\nUse a pencil of any colour other than black, a marker pen, or a crayon.\nCut pre-painted steel material with care to avoid marring the high-quality finish. Cut by shear only - use nibblers\nor hand shears. Friction blades and high-speed saw blades must not be used on metal cladding. These blades will\ndamage both the metallic coating and the pre-painted steel surface by creating excessive heat, and generate large\namounts of hot swarf, which will get embedded into the coating surface\nAll debris must be swept off the job at the end of each day. Prevention of swarf damage is far easier than its cure.\n(See 14.18.4.1 Preventing Swarf Damage).\n 14 \n 14.9 MARKING AND CUTTING\n 9 \n 14 \n 14.9 \n386\nThis is a controlled document.

When the ends are not\nbaffled by spouting, the recommended minimum is 70 mm.\n14.10A Minimum Overhang\n Underlay must not overhang the fascia by more than 20 mm or, if eaves flashings are used, terminate on the\nupper side of the flashing. Do not drape underlay into the gutter.\n 14 \n 14.10 OVERHANG\n 10 \n 14 \n 14.10 \n387\nThis is a controlled document.

When unavoidable, the end lap of should be\nsealed with a double bead of sealant as in the illustration below. Alternatively, self- adhesive closed cell tape can\nbe used in the same position.\n14.11.1A Sealed End Lap\n14.11.2 \nSide Laps \nSide laps should be fitted evenly and snugly without excessive gaps or tension. Sheets exhibiting edge wave\nshould be reported to the supplier immediately. Where a sheet width exceeds the distance to the next\narchitectural feature, it should be slit to width; not given multiple overlaps to decrease its effective cover width.\nThis will prevent water being\ndrawn up by capillary action\nSeal top edge of lap to prevent\ningress of condensation.\nPotential corrosion area\n 14 \n 14.11 SEALING AND JOINING\n 11 \n 14 \n 14.11 \n388\nThis is a controlled document.

Fasteners used pre-painted steel products\nshould be factory colour matched before installation.\n14.12.1 \nNails \nThe traditional New Zealand roof fastener was, until 1980, the \"Lead Head\", a flat-headed smooth\nshank steel nail with a lead head cast on it. Lead heads often 'backed out', causing leaks, the\nshanks were prone to corrosion, and lead is incompatible with modern metallic coatings.\nSpiral Shank nail fasteners have a galvanised shank, and the spiral shank has over twice the\nwithdrawal resistance of a smooth shanked nail. They are however still prone to backing out, and\nthe under-head seal is not as robust as the neoprene seals used on modern roofing screws.\nThe COP recommends using screws rather than driven fasteners, in all cases.\n14.12.1A Nail Pull-out\nDriven Fasteners can back out over time.\n14.12.2 \nScrews \nScrew fasteners should be long enough to give adequate penetration into the supporting structure. Generally,\n30 mm embedment is required for screws into timber or three threads engagement for screws into steel. Refer to\nroofing manufacturers for specific recommendations.\n 14 \n 14.12 FASTENERS\n 12 \n 14 \n 14.12 \n389\nThis is a controlled document.

The drill point\nmay be type 17 for driving into timber or drill point for driving into steel. Reduced diameter drill points, which can\nbe used for either function, are also available.\n14.12.3 \nClip Fasteners \n 14 \n 14.12 FASTENERS\n 12 \n 14 \n 14.12 \n391\nThis is a controlled document.

These profiles offer the advantages of fewer penetrations through the cladding, and thermal expansion is\nunimpeded.\nClip and bracket fasteners can be purpose made to provide the same attributes to most flashings.\n14.12.4 \nRivets \nRivets should have a minimum diameter of 4 mm.\nUse aluminium rivets for galvanised sheets and aluminium/zinc-coated steel products; monel rivets are\nincompatible with aluminium and zinc products.\nSealed rivets are preferred over unsealed rivets, as they do not require adding sealant on the face to achieve\nweatherproofing.\n14.12.4A Rivet Setting\nJaws\nMandrel\nMandre\nMandrel head\nAfter setting\nBlind rivets are placed through a pre-drilled hole then are set by rivet tool withdrawing the mandrel. This expands\nthe rivet pin, clamping the material between the rivet pin and the rivet head. The pin eventually snaps free.\n 14 \n 14.12 FASTENERS\n 12 \n 14 \n 14.12 \n392\nThis is a controlled document.

Resilient\nwashers under fastener heads will only seal properly with the right adjustment.\n14.13A Depth Setting\nDrilling and\nthread forming\nCorrect \nsealing\nIncorrect \nsealing\nThree threads\nExperienced operators can, in most instances, drive screws correctly by using a variable speed screw gun;\nhowever, a depth set gun will give more consistent results.\nType 17 screws driven into timber will 'part' the fibres rather than cutting them which provides a self-locking\naction against withdrawal. Screws driven completely through timber will, therefore, not have the same pull-out\nresistance as screws with embedded tips.\nImpact drivers and poorly fitting nut drivers can both damage the protective coating on the screw head which will\naffect durability. It is the roofer's responsibility to ensure the method of installing screws does not cause\ndamage.\nScrew points, method of driving, and thread design all have an impact on pull-out capacity; so in critical\nsituations, the specific screw and method of installation must be specified.\n14.13.1 \nFastener Spacing \nFasteners should be of grade and type suitable for the application, installed at spacings required by design loads\nand manufacturer's recommendations.\nOn buildings constructed to NZS 3604, a consistent fixing pattern should be used on all fastener rows; for other\nbuildings, higher fastener density may be required around the periphery. All purlins must be fastened to so that\nthey each contribute to resisting uplift loads. See 3.9 Fastener Requirements and Overhangs.\nRivets on flashings should be placed at 50 mm centres.\n14.13.2 \nFastener Placement \n 14 \n 14.13 FASTENER INSTALLATION\n 13 \n 14 \n 14.13 \n393\nThis is a controlled document.

Wall cladding fasteners can be placed at the\ncrest or the pan. Pan fixing of wall cladding is more popular as the screw lines are less visible.\nN.B. The pullover design values established by testing for pan fixing are more than twice those for crest\nfixing.\n14.13.3 \nFastener Seating \nFasteners should be seated snugly to give a good seal, without distorting the roofing profile. Any \"pigtails\"\ncreated by the drilling process must be removed before seating the screw.\n14.13.4 \nFastener Allowance for Expansion \nAll roofing and cladding are subject to expansion and contraction due to temperature extremes. This is\nparticularly evident with darker colours and long spans where the expansion may be as much as 8 mm for a 10 m\nsheet. Screws fitted with profiled washers to allow for thermal expansion must be installed centrally through a\n9 mm diameter pre-drilled hole in the roof sheeting.\n 14 \n 14.13 FASTENER INSTALLATION\n 13 \n 14 \n 14.13 \n394\nThis is a controlled document.

Where profiled load spreading washers are\nrequired to eliminate this, it is important that the specified washer is used. When fastening to light gauge steel\npurlins, thread strip out may be the lower failure point. The pull-out failure point is very dependent on drill point,\nthread shape, and pitch; it is essential in such cases to use a correctly specified fastener.\n14.14A Pull-Over\n14.14B Pull Out\n14.14C Thread Strip Out\n14.14D Back Out\n 14 \n 14.14 MODES OF FASTENER FAILURE\n 14 \n 14 \n 14.14 \n395\nThis is a controlled document.

Stop-ends for trapezoidal and\ncorrugate profiles can only be of the pull-up type. Where the stop-end cannot be full height because of the profile\ndesign or is purposely left low to facilitate ventilation, the height of the stop-end must be at least 25mm.\nThe stop-end tool should be a proprietary tool designed for the product being used, with chamfered edges to\nminimise damage to the coating. Stop-ends to high tensile trough sections can typically only be effectively\nformed to the height of the S-bend in the rib.\nStop ending can distort the pan adjacent to the turn-up. Techniques such as standing in the pan being formed and\nsupporting the pan on a flat surface can minimise this but it is difficult to eliminate, particularly with wide pans\nand high-tensile material. \nThe cover of over flashings should be sufficient to minimise water ponding caused by deformation during the\nstop-ending process. Deformation of the pan will also cause variation in the gap between notched flashings and\nthe profile. Variations in the gap are acceptable, but contact with the edge of the flashing and the pan of the\nprofile must be avoided.\n14.15A Dog-eared Stop-ends\nA 'dog-eared' or full stop-end is made by cutting the rib back to the height of the profile so the material can be\ndressed and \"wrapped around\" 90 deg . It is not possible to dog-ear stop-end many profiles because of the shape of\ntheir rib.\nTo create dog-eared stop-ends:\nSlit all ribs to a length equivalent to their height.\nCut away the tops of the ribs at a slight upwards angle and remove.\n 14 \n 14.15 STOP-ENDS\n 15 \n 14 \n 14.15 \n396\nThis is a controlled document.

There should be a gap between\nthe downturn and the adjacent rib to prevent capillary action and to allow for pressure equalisation. Both vertical\nand horizontal faces of the flashing should be fastened to other cladding or preferably, through the cladding to the\nstructure.\nTransverse flashings may be notched over the ribs of the profile, or for lower trapezoidal profiles or corrugate\nthey can be fitted with a soft edging which is dressed into the pan of the profile. All soft edging must be colour\nmatched to the roof before installation. Soft edging can be solid aluminium, solidly backed, or perforated to allow\nventilation. The leading edge of transverse flashings must be through fastened to the primary structure, not\nriveted to the cladding.\n 14 \n 14.17 SOFT EDGING AND FLASHING\n 17 \n 14 \n 14.17 \n399\nThis is a controlled document.

If this is unacceptable, roofs should be designed to Unrestricted Access criteria and roof access and\nusage by other trades should be strongly managed and supervised.\n A small ding in a sheet will not normally cause any structural problems and may be aesthetically acceptable;\nhowever, deeper dings can cause cracking of the sheet and lead to leaks.\nTo restore a damaged rib load capability to the original levels, all damage must be repaired with a cap flashing.\nFor aesthetic reasons, any damage may be unacceptable. However, if the roof cladding is not visible, ribs can be\nrepaired by using a sealed and riveted saddle cap.\n14.18.1A Sealed and Riveted Saddle\nSeal and rivet\nThis ding must also be repaired\nIt is technically acceptable to have two dings or creases on one sheet within one purlin spacing, providing two\nadjacent ribs are not damaged. Any greater level of damage requires the sheets to be replaced, and the person\nwho causes the damage must report it and be responsible for its repair.\n14.18.2 \nWater Ponding \n 14 \n 14.18 AVOIDING PROBLEMS\n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n400\nThis is a controlled document.

Ponding will detract from a\ncoated steel product's life and will invalidate the product warranty.\nThe installation of penetrations must be done in such a way that they do not cause ponding. See External\nMoisture: Penetrations.\nOn low pitched roofs, careless or excessive foot traffic may cause rib damage and localised ponding. This can be\nminimised by installing temporary protection in critical areas, such as entry points, where the roof is accessed by\nother trades, or there is a step-down in the roof. It is the main contractor's responsibility to ensure that other\ntrades do not damage the roof.\nIt is recommended to design to Unrestricted Access-criteria or better if roofs are highly visible or need to be\nregularly accessed by maintenance personnel.\n14.18.3 \nCorrectly Installed Gutters \nGutters must be installed with adequate fall to ensure water is transported to appropriately located downpipes.\nFalls and joints should be constructed so that water does not pond to a depth of more than 5 mm. Regular gutter\ncleaning and maintenance are required to remove leaves and other debris that may restrict water flow to\ndownpipes. Vertical downpipes are parallel to the wall and adjacent vertical references, such as window jambs.\nA gutter protection system (or any other product) that entraps debris or water between itself and any steel\nproduct surfaces, restricting coated steel's ability to dry, is not recommended and is an exclusion in the product\nwarranty.\n14.18.3A Incorrectly Installed Gutter Protection System\n14.18.4 \nSwarf Damage \nSwarf is the term given to the metal debris arising from cutting or piercing operations when using friction saws,\ndrills, or other tools on roofing and cladding products.

These stains are often mistaken for early deterioration of the roofing and cladding itself.\nSee 4.14 Swarf Staining and Cut Edge Corrosion.\n14.18.4.1 \nPreventing Swarf Damage \nCutting\nCut only by shear; power shears or hand snips produce the least amount of debris.\nPower nibblers give a clean cut but generate debris which if left is prone to corrosion.\nDo not use metal friction blades or reciprocating saws which produce fine hot particles which can embed\ndeeply into the coating surface and corrode rapidly.\nIf metal grinding is taking place near the surface of an installed or uninstalled roof, careful masking of nearby\ncoated steel surfaces must be executed.\nClean-up\nSwarf should be swept or hosed from the job progressively and certainly no less than at the end of each day.\nSwarf that has become stuck must be removed carefully, avoiding action which is likely to remove or change the\nappearance of the paint or metal coatings.\nWhen sweeping or hosing into a gutter, clean out the gutter before leaving the job to prevent premature corrosion.\nOn completion of the job, give a final wash or sweep down.\n14.18.4.2 \nSevere or Extensive Swarf Staining \nIf the coating is severely damaged by swarf corrosion, the area should be painted or replaced. The whole visible\narea should be repaired, as air drying paints weather more rapidly and in a different manner to pre-painted roofing\nand cladding products. If swarf particles are painted over, rust bleed-through is likely to occur.\n14.18.4.3 \nSupervising Other Trades \nA common cause of swarf complaints arises because other trades have used grinding equipment in\nthe vicinity of a newly completed roof. Wind carried swarf can contaminate large areas some\ndistance from the cutting site. Main contractors should be aware of the likelihood of such damage,\nand project planning should include scheduling of all cutting or grinding work to be completed\nbefore laying the roof cladding.\n14.18.5 \nColour Matching Paint \n 14 \n 14.18 AVOIDING PROBLEMS\n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n402\nThis is a controlled document.

The term touch-up paint should never be used. Fasteners and accessories requiring\ncolour matching should be painted before installation.\nAir-dried paints used to disguise marks weather at a rate different from that of pre-painted material, sometimes\ndramatically so, and will often become more apparent than the mark they are intended to disguise. Minor\nscratches are best left alone, and they will not affect the performance of the pre-painted product due to the self-\nhealing qualities of the primer and metallic coating. They become less evident as the coating weathers.\nMinor scratches may be described as scratches that do not extend to the metallic coating, are less than 3 mm in\nwidth, and are not visually noticeable from a distance of 3 m. This characterisation will, however, vary with the\nconcentration of the scratches, and the visibility of the area affected.\nExtensive coating damage to any pre-painted steel product can only be rectified by replacement or repainting of\nthe affected sheets.\n14.18.5A Visual Impact of Mismatched Paint\n14.18.6 \nField Painting \n 14 \n 14.18 AVOIDING PROBLEMS\n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n403\nThis is a controlled document.

Metallic coated roofs can be painted immediately after installation; however, dirt, grease, and any loose\nmaterials must be cleaned off, so the surface is clean and dry before applying the first coat.\nAn effective method for painting metallic coated roofing is to apply a good quality galvanised iron primer and two\nwater-based acrylic topcoats, following the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPre-painted products can be painted after exposure to weather. Normally, 6-12 months of exposure is required to\nachieve surface modification of the surface to allow the new coating to adhere.\nEdge laps of unpainted metallic coated sheets steel do not require lap priming.\n14.18.7 \nSunscreen \nSunscreen containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide can accelerate the degradation of organic materials including\nauto finishes and pre-painted cladding surfaces. This damage is irreparable, so prevention of its occurrence is the\nonly defence.

However,\nto acquire the required fastener durability, use aluminium or stainless screws rather than painted steel screws.\nAluminium screws require pre-drilled pilot holes into the purlin.\nAluminium has approximately twice the thermal expansion of steel, therefore, expansion provisions must be\nexecuted as for steel of twice the length.\nBeing soft and frequently requiring oversize holes for expansion, aluminium is typically fastened with fasteners\nequipped with load spreading washers, as is reflected in published span tables. Installers must adhere to\npublished fastening systems to meet design load/span expectations.\n14.19A Fixing Aluminium \nGutter front height \nabove rib level at \neaves\nSolid soffit or \nceiling lining\nAluminium \neaves flashing\nAluminium or stainless \nsteel fasteners through \nover sized holes\nProfiled aluminium \nwasher\nStainless steel \nstaples\nPurlins clear of \nexposed steel \nfasteners\nNon-corrosive underlay suppor\n14.19.1 \nPainted Aluminium \nPainted aluminium products perform differently than uncoated aluminium as the paint coating affects reactions\nwith the atmosphere, and reduces the aluminium surface area that can be sacrificed to defend against localised\ncorrosion.\nPitted corrosion can result from damage to the paint coating and exposure to corrosive substances. It is\nnecessary to protect against wet contact with concrete, treated timber, steel, stainless steel, and butyl rubber.\n14.19.2 \nRecommendations for Fixing Aluminium \na.\nThe front edge of the spouting or gutter must be higher than the crest of the roofing profile.\nb.\nEaves flashings of painted or unpainted aluminium must be used.

If present, it\nmust be separated by a 5 mm non-compressible barrier of inert, non-absorbent, non-reactive material.\nAlternatively, self-supporting underlays may be used. Plastic strapping can be used for supporting\nunderlays, stapled with stainless steel staples to the vertical face of the purlins.\ne.\nIn a wet environment, aluminium must be separated from a corrosive surface such as concrete, butyl\nrubber, or CCA-treated timber by using a 5 mm rigid strip of an inert non-absorbent material, an open woven\ngeotextile layer, or PVC netting. Plastic-coated steel netting is not recommended under aluminium\nsheeting.\nf.\nThe design of the ceiling cavity must prevent the saturation of support members from internal or ground\nmoisture. (See 10 Internal Moisture.)\ng.\nAll screws should be fitted with a profiled or bonded washer. Fixing screws shall be aluminium or Grade\n304 stainless steel. Stainless steel screws must be fitted centrally through pre-drilled oversized holes\n(9 mm) for roofing and walls, regardless of sheet length.\nh.\nFor sheet lengths over 3 m, the provision to allow for thermal expansion must be in accordance with the\ntables in 7.3 Thermal Expansion And Contraction.\n 14 \n 14.19 FIXING ALUMINIUM SHEETING\n 14 \n 14.19 \n406\nThis is a controlled document.

It is prudent if he records any damage to the sheets (or lack thereof) at this point, particularly if\nsubsequent trades accessing the roof. Damage of any sort caused by other trades is not the responsibility of the\nroofer.\nAll gutters, valleys, roof channels and the roof cladding should be left clean and free from debris on completion of\nthe work, and any roofing related debris on site should be safely removed.\n 14 \n 14.20 COMPLETION\n 20 \n 14 \n 14.20 \n407\nThis is a controlled document.

See External\nMoisture: Penetrations.\nOn low pitched roofs, careless or excessive foot traffic may cause rib damage and localised ponding. This can be\nminimised by installing temporary protection in critical areas, such as entry points, where the roof is accessed by\nother trades, or there is a step-down in the roof. It is the main contractor's responsibility to ensure that other\ntrades do not damage the roof.\nIt is recommended to design to Unrestricted Access-criteria or better if roofs are highly visible or need to be\nregularly accessed by maintenance personnel.\n14.18.3 \nCorrectly Installed Gutters \nGutters must be installed with adequate fall to ensure water is transported to appropriately located downpipes.\nFalls and joints should be constructed so that water does not pond to a depth of more than 5 mm. Regular gutter\ncleaning and maintenance are required to remove leaves and other debris that may restrict water flow to\ndownpipes. Vertical downpipes are parallel to the wall and adjacent vertical references, such as window jambs.\nA gutter protection system (or any other product) that entraps debris or water between itself and any steel\nproduct surfaces, restricting coated steel's ability to dry, is not recommended and is an exclusion in the product\nwarranty.\n14.18.3A Incorrectly Installed Gutter Protection System\n14.18.4 \nSwarf Damage \nSwarf is the term given to the metal debris arising from cutting or piercing operations when using friction saws,\ndrills, or other tools on roofing and cladding products.

These stains are often mistaken for early deterioration of the roofing and cladding itself.\nSee 4.14 Swarf Staining and Cut Edge Corrosion.\n14.18.4.1 \nPreventing Swarf Damage \nCutting\nCut only by shear; power shears or hand snips produce the least amount of debris.\nPower nibblers give a clean cut but generate debris which if left is prone to corrosion.\nDo not use metal friction blades or reciprocating saws which produce fine hot particles which can embed\ndeeply into the coating surface and corrode rapidly.\nIf metal grinding is taking place near the surface of an installed or uninstalled roof, careful masking of nearby\ncoated steel surfaces must be executed.\nClean-up\nSwarf should be swept or hosed from the job progressively and certainly no less than at the end of each day.\nSwarf that has become stuck must be removed carefully, avoiding action which is likely to remove or change the\nappearance of the paint or metal coatings.\nWhen sweeping or hosing into a gutter, clean out the gutter before leaving the job to prevent premature corrosion.\nOn completion of the job, give a final wash or sweep down.\n14.18.4.2 \nSevere or Extensive Swarf Staining \nIf the coating is severely damaged by swarf corrosion, the area should be painted or replaced. The whole visible\narea should be repaired, as air drying paints weather more rapidly and in a different manner to pre-painted roofing\nand cladding products. If swarf particles are painted over, rust bleed-through is likely to occur.\n14.18.4.3 \nSupervising Other Trades \nA common cause of swarf complaints arises because other trades have used grinding equipment in\nthe vicinity of a newly completed roof. Wind carried swarf can contaminate large areas some\ndistance from the cutting site. Main contractors should be aware of the likelihood of such damage,\nand project planning should include scheduling of all cutting or grinding work to be completed\nbefore laying the roof cladding.\n14.18.5 \nColour Matching Paint \n 14 INSTALLATION\n 14 \n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n402\nThis is a controlled document.

The term touch-up paint should never be used. Fasteners and accessories requiring\ncolour matching should be painted before installation.\nAir-dried paints used to disguise marks weather at a rate different from that of pre-painted material, sometimes\ndramatically so, and will often become more apparent than the mark they are intended to disguise. Minor\nscratches are best left alone, and they will not affect the performance of the pre-painted product due to the self-\nhealing qualities of the primer and metallic coating. They become less evident as the coating weathers.\nMinor scratches may be described as scratches that do not extend to the metallic coating, are less than 3 mm in\nwidth, and are not visually noticeable from a distance of 3 m. This characterisation will, however, vary with the\nconcentration of the scratches, and the visibility of the area affected.\nExtensive coating damage to any pre-painted steel product can only be rectified by replacement or repainting of\nthe affected sheets.\n14.18.5A Visual Impact of Mismatched Paint\n14.18.6 \nField Painting \n 14 INSTALLATION\n 14 \n 18 \n 14 \n 14.18 \n403\nThis is a controlled document.

Metallic coated roofs can be painted immediately after installation; however, dirt, grease, and any loose\nmaterials must be cleaned off, so the surface is clean and dry before applying the first coat.\nAn effective method for painting metallic coated roofing is to apply a good quality galvanised iron primer and two\nwater-based acrylic topcoats, following the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPre-painted products can be painted after exposure to weather. Normally, 6-12 months of exposure is required to\nachieve surface modification of the surface to allow the new coating to adhere.\nEdge laps of unpainted metallic coated sheets steel do not require lap priming.\n14.18.7 \nSunscreen \nSunscreen containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide can accelerate the degradation of organic materials including\nauto finishes and pre-painted cladding surfaces. This damage is irreparable, so prevention of its occurrence is the\nonly defence.
