Therefore, they perform an important role in the aesthetic\nappearance of the building.\nIt takes longer to make and install flashings than fixing roof or wall cladding, so designers should be aware of the\ncost effects of design complexity.\nSee it in action with Roofguide\nMany common flashing solutions are expanded on with step-by-step, interactive 3D instructions in the\nRANZ Roofing Guide, developed by the Roofing Association of New Zealand in association with the\nNZMRM.\nWorks on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.\nFind out more at www.roofguide.co.nz\nFlashing Materials \nExposed flashings are typically manufactured using the same base metal material as used for the roof and wall\ncladding. If flashings are required to match the colour of the profiled cladding, it is necessary for the pre-painted\nflat sheet or coil to be made by the same manufacturer, using the same process. When it is not possible, or if\ndifferent materials are intended or specified, the alternative materials should be compatible considering both\ncontact and runoff. (See 4.9.4 Compatibility Table)\nAll flashings must be fabricated from a ductile material and designed for lateral strength by folding, stiffening, or\nribbing on external edges, with a maximum unstiffened width of 300 mm.\nVertical faces of flashings such as barges and fascia can exhibit oil canning. This can be minimised by using\nheavier gauge material, by forming stiffeners, or by providing clip fastened attachment systems which allow for\nthermal movement. In critical visual areas, the COP recommends a maximum unstiffened depth of 200 mm on the\nvertical face.\nMetal flashings must have a bend radius complying with the minimum radii prescribed in 4.10.8\nMicrocracking.\nThe minimum thickness for metal flashings must be:\nCoated steel - 0.55 mm,\nAluminium - 0.70 mm,\nCopper - 0.60 mm,\nZinc - 0.70 mm,\nStainless steel - 0.45 mm.\nProprietary EPDM penetration flashings are detailed in 9.5 Boot Flashings.\n8.1.1 \nFlashing Durability \nWhere a flashing is hidden or is otherwise difficult to access for maintenance or replacement, or it requires\ncladding to be removed to replace the flashing, it must have durability for the life of the building or not less than\n50 years. All flashings should be made from materials with a durability expectation not less than that of the\ncladding.\nIn some corrosive environments, stainless steel or non-ferrous metals should be used for flashings. All metals\nmust be checked for compatibility with the roof material. (See 4.9 Compatibility and 4.9.4A Interactive\nMaterial Compatibility Tool)\nFlashing Design \nTransverse flashings run across the roof slope at right angles to the ribs of the roof and longitudinal flashings run\ndown the roof slope.\nIngress of rain into the roof or wall cavity via the flashings can be caused by the pressure differential between the\nair outside and that inside the roof or wall cavity. The pressure differential caused by wind gusting fluctuates\ngreatly, so a gap should be created behind the outer edge of a flashing to provide a pressure cushion. Longitudinal\nflashings are best designed with a pressure equalisation gap to balance varying pressures and prevent capillary\naction. (See 4.10.6 Capillary Action.)\nThe preferred maximum production length of flashing is 6-8 m, depending on profile strength. As any sealed lap\nsecured by rivets or screws effectively becomes one length, provide expansion joints where required. Flashings\nare similarly restricted in length as roof and wall cladding sheets and are subject to the same requirements and\nexpansion provisions. (See 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion Provisions.) Inadequate provision for flashing\nexpansion can also cause roof noise\nAvoid wet contact between the edges of flashings and concrete, plaster or butyl rubber (See 4.9\nCompatibility.) When notched flashings are used, the cut edge must not touch the pan, as that can cause\ncorrosion from abrasion.\n8.2A Notched Flashing\n2mm - 5mm\nclearance\nScrew to purlin\nCut tab and bend under\nNo Gap.

The void in between these\ntwo barriers acts as a pressure equalisation gap. \nSoft edging can be supplied in material compatible with the roofing material. This may be a naturally malleable\nmetal, or metal perforated to enable it to be shaped to the profile, see 17.3 MRM Soft Edge Standard.\nStop ends must be provided for all pitches in all wind zones\nIn extreme circumstances, a profiled or notched closure can be used between the stop end and the downturn or\nsoft edge. When closures or filler blocks are used, they must be adhered to the profile or secured by the cladding\nfasteners to ensure they remain in position.\nAdditional ventilation requirements must be considered when using profiled closures, see 10.10 Ventilation\nPathways.\n8.2.1A Hemmed Flashing\n\n8.2.1B Kick-out Flashing\n8.2.1C Bird's Beak Flashing\n8.2.1D Notched Flashing Edge\n8.2.1E Boxed Flashing\n\n8.2.1F Kick-in Flashing\n8.2.1G Flashing Hook\nAnti-capillary hems must be flattened parallel but not completely crushed.\n8.2.1H Flashing Hem or Crush Fold\nMetal Fascias and Facades \nWhere the vertical planes of metal facings are exposed to sight, they should be designed to allow movement and\nminimise thermal buckling, and buckling from timber shrinkage. Maximum dimension between folds should be\nrestricted to 300 mm where possible, or swages installed to stiffen the panel. Constructing such flashings from\nthicker material will also help prevent distortion, but availability of such may be subject to minimum order\nquantities. Edges should be clip-fastened to allow thermal movement, and lengths over 6 m should be installed\nwith a thermal expansion joint. This can be constructed as an overlap, or a negative detail with sheet ends\noverlapping an under-soaker, with a gap between the ends of the exposed faces. Typically, this gap would be\n5 mm for steel flashings, and 10 mm for aluminium. 8.5.3 Parapet Cappings shows an example of a parapet\ncap expansion detail.\n8.3A Buckling in Metal Fascia Due to Thermal Expansion\nFlashing Cover \nThe weathertightness of a flashing is determined by the flashing cover (C), not the flashing dimension.(D) Other\nconsiderations are catchment area, wind exposure, roof pitch and profile height.\n8.4A Flashing Dimension 'D' and Cover 'C'\nC1\nC2\nD 2\nD 1\nThe minimum flashing cover (C) must correlate with the tables below.\nThere are four categories of exposure or pitch that determine the required flashing cover .\nCategory A:\nLow, Medium or High Wind Zones, all pitches\nVery High and Extra High Wind Zones where the pitch is equal to or greater than 10 deg .\nCategory B:\nVery High where the pitch is less than 10 deg , and\nExtra High Wind Zones all pitches. \nCategory C:\nSED Wind Zones up to 60 m/s, all pitches.\nCategory D:\nSED up to 68 m/s, all pitches.\n8.4B Minimum Flashing Cover\nNOTE: These tables are relevant to trapezoidal profiles with a rib height of 20 - 34 mm and standard\ncorrugate.

In such cases, a clearance of 20 mm\nis sufficient to prevent contamination and prolonged wetness of the cladding.\nThe 5 mm clearance to inter-storey junctions and window heads is not achievable when the horizontal flashing\nhas a slope of 15 deg . The clearance at the back of the flashing/roof pan should be minimal, 2 - 5 mm, and the slope\nof the flashing should be decreased to minimise the clearance at the rib crest. For vermin proofing, the maximum\nclearance at the rib should be 8 mm.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BC01 Clearance between sheet ends\nand transverse flashings.\nExtract:\n\"The Metal Roofing and Wall Cladding Code of Practice (COP) stipulates clearance should be provided\nbetween the bottom edge of a profiled sheet and a transverse flashing, such as a change of pitch\nflashing. The purpose of such clearance is to prevent the end of the profiled sheet from damaging the\nprotective coating on the flashing, due to movement of the former from thermal expansion...\"\nRidging and Other Transverse Flashings \nA soft edge or notched flashing must be provided to transverse flashings. The positioning of the top purlin must\nbe adjusted with the pitch and the ridge girth to ensure that primary fastening is provided between 15 mm and 50\nmm from the leading edge of the flashing. See 8.4C Ridge and Head Flashing Cover.\n8.4.4 \nFlashing Laps \nLaps in flashings should comply with the following criteria:\nwater must flow over a lap, not into it,\na lap must not rely solely on sealant,\nsealed laps must be mechanically fixed at 50 mm centres,\nunsealed laps must have a minimum cover of 150 mm, and\na minimum of 100 mm cover is recommended for sealed laps to facilitate the correct alignment of two\nflashings.\nFlashing Types \nDifferent types of flashings include:\nRidge and Hip.\nBarge and Verge.\nParapet Cappings.\nApron.\nValley.\nCurved.\nSee 9 External Moisture Penetrations for penetration flashings.\n8.5.1 \nRidge and Hip Intersections \nRidge and hip roll top flashings are roll-formed as a standard pitch flashing with a soft edge.\nWhen the angle of the flashing is not custom-made to suit the roof, it can result in visible distortion\nand stress around the fastening if used on pitches steeper than 35 deg .\nCustom-made square top ridging is available for any pitch and width and is available in lengths of\nup to 8 m. The roll top or square top of a ridging helps accommodate expansion of the roof sheeting\nand strengthens the ridge.\nA vee ridge is not able to support walking traffic and is vulnerable to buckling caused by point\nload and lateral or longitudinal thermal movement.\nA soft-edged flashing can be used for corrugated and low rib trapezoidal profiles, and notched\nridging can be used on all trapezoidal, trough or standing seam profiles.\n8.5.1A Ridge-Hip Junction\n\n8.5.1B Ridge-hip Intersection\nFit apex ridge over\nScribe and fold\nover hip ridges\nSoaker under-flashing if\nrequired.\nMitre hip\nridges\n8.5.1C Ridge End\nShape to point\nCut and\nfold in\n The transition of the ridge and the apex of a hip requires skill to make a neat and weathertight finish and relies\non sealant for prolonged weather tightness. An under-flashing such as soft aluminium,underlay, or butyl flexible\nmemberane may be used as a secondary means of waterproofing; but with a tidily executed intersection these are\nnot necessary for weather-proofness.\nThe gable end termination of roll ridging must be made vermin proof by cutting the ridging back 25 mm and\nclosing it. \nAs an alternative to continuous ridging on ribbed profiled sheets, use individual rib or ridge caps fitted to each rib\nafter the ribs have been cut and the roof cladding bent over the ridge. Each cap should be accurately fitted and\nsealed. This method does not allow for free expansion at the ridge of long length roof cladding and restricts\nnatural ventilation of the ceiling cavity. These caps rely on sealant to be made watertight and are only\nrecommended for use at the apex of a roof and when there is sufficient ventilation.\nBarge And Verge \nBarge or verge flashings assist in holding the roof cladding in place under high wind loads at the periphery.\nWhere barge flashings are omitted, the roof must be designed to withstand the upwards loads imposed on both\nsurfaces of the roof cladding edges.\nA transition flashing must be provided when the roof cladding weathers the barge at an internal angle.\n8.5.2A Transition Flashings \n8.5.2B Stepped Fascia Corrugate Under Barge\nCorrugated Roofing\nFastener\nPurlin\nUnder-barge\nFascia\n\n8.5.2C Stepped Fascia Corrugate Over Barge\nBarge\nGutters omitted for clarity\n8.5.2D Stepped Fascia Trapezoidal Under Barge\nTrapezoidal Roofing\nFastener\nSealed Rivet\nFascia\nUnder-barge\nPurlin\n\n8.5.2E Stepped Fascia Trapezoidal Over Barge\nDo not block more than 50% of pan\nRivet and seal 28 x 50\nangle to pan; fit barge\nover\n8.5.2F Tray Roofing-Wall Connection\n3.

Having a clip fastened outer edge will minimise rippling of the face\nbut will not allow the free movement of a clip fastened option.\n1. The capping is fastened to the parapet on both sides using screws with embossed washers through oversized\nholes.\n2. A continuous cleat is fastened on the exterior face of the wall with an open hem at the drip for ease of\napplication. After the exterior face of the capping is hooked to the cleat, the capping on the interior side is\nsecured to the parapet using fasteners with embossed washers through oversized holes.\n\n3. Intermittent clips are fastened to the exterior face of the wall at 600 mm centres. All cleats and clips should be\naccurately aligned by string line during installation\n8.5.3E Fixed Cap to Concrete\n85 deg \nConcrete\nClearance\nClearance\nUnderlay\n8.5.3F Cap-fixed Parapet Cap to Smooth Profile Inner\n85 deg \nUnderlay\n\n8.5.3G Parapet Cap Fixed to Profiled Cladding\n85 deg \nUnderlay\nInstead of chasing into the wall or using a E Parapet Flashing - Face-Fixed, the preferred detail is to cover\nthe inside of the parapet wall with vertical ribbed metal or other cladding material, used in conjunction with an\napron flashing and parapet cap. (See 8.5.4B Vertical Cladding (Parapet Flashing and Detail))\nParapet Cap Slope\nParapet cappings that follow the slope of the roof do not require any fall across its width, but transverse parapet\ncappings must have a positive slope of onto the roof side to avoid ponding and encourage free draining. This\nslope should be 3 - 5 deg . Parapet cappings wider than 300 mm can fall both ways, with the drainage slope provided\non each side.\n\n8.5.3H Parapet-Roof Intersection\nHem\nLap\n8.5.4 \nApron Flashings \nCladding should not fit tightly onto the horizontal surface of any apron flashing; as it could retain moisture and\ncollect dirt and debris. It should have a minimum clearance of 25 mm to allow for cleaning and maintenance.\nApron flashings should be in position before the cladding is installed. Where replacement of the flashing requires\nremoval of the cladding above it, Figure 1 and Table 1 of B2/AS1 require the flashing to have a durability of 50\nyears. Durability can be achieved by using flashings made from non-ferrous materials. Alternatively, a 8.5.4F\nTwo-piece Apron should be used where the over-flashing has 50-year durability, and the apron flashing can be\nrenewed independently.\nWhen the parapet walls will be plastered or when other trades are likely to follow the roof cladding installation,\nthe roof cladding, and flashings should be protected from damage. Provision should also be made for working\nand walking on the roof cladding during this time.\nWhere an apron abuts a block, brick, or concrete wall without any cladding above it, the apron flashing can be\nweathered by a step or a continuous chased flashing. These flashings can be made from aluminium, stainless\nsteel, or zinc when used with metallic-coated steels and should extend 25 mm into the wall. They should be\nhooked or mechanically wedged and should be sealed using a compatible, flexible mortar or sealant. Over-clad\nflashings give better weather protection than chase-cut flashings.\n\n8.5.4A Chased Apron\n8.5.4B Vertical Cladding (Parapet Flashing and Detail)\n\n8.5.4C Angle Diverter\nDiverter\nStop end\n8.5.4D Angled Apron - 110 deg \nStop end\n8.5.4E Angled Apron - 45 deg \nStop end\n\n8.5.4F Two-piece Apron\n8.5.4A Chased Apron and 8.5.4C Angle Diverter are not the preferred installation methods for apron\nflashings. 8.5.4B Vertical Cladding (Parapet Flashing and Detail)shows a better method that provides\nmore positive weathering by covering the wall with vertical metal cladding up to the capping.\nIt is not possible to ensure that all the water discharged from the apron flashing will be collected by the spouting,\nunless special provisions are made including:\nan angle diverter should be sealed and fastened to the apron. (See 8.5.4C Angle Diverter);\nthe side apron flashing can be folded to 110 deg ( see 8.5.4D Angled Apron - 110 deg );\nan apron internal angle flashing can be folded to two angles at 135 deg (See 8.5.4E Angled Apron - 45 deg ); or\nusing a two-piece apron (See 8.5.4F Two-piece Apron).\nSpouting should be fitted after the wall has been finished and should be clear of the wall cladding.\nAprons should be stop-ended and turned down to weather and bird-proof the end of the apron at this junction.\nWhen flashing a cavity parapet, the apron should be in place before the cavity batten as it is not possible to\nretrofit the apron. The apron material should have a 50-year durability unless the parapet cladding is easy to\nreplace.\nWhen a chase or rebate (8.5.4G Chase-fixed Flashing) is not provided, a pressure bar flashing can be used\nto weather an apron flashing into a concrete tilt-up slab wall. \n\n8.5.4G Chase-fixed Flashing\nPolysulphide \nsealand\n80 deg \n20\n10mm\n110mm\nNon-\nferrous\nBacking rod\nSealant\nDepth of\nflashing into\npanel\nOver-clad apron flashings are always preferred to chase-cut alternatives in structures such as residences where\nthe occurrence of chase-cut weatherproofing failure could have severe consequences.\n\n8.5.4H Parapet - Reglet Flashing, Chase Cut\nDetail of Sealing Flashing\nPF Backer Rod\nMS Sealant\nFix head flashing to top\npurlin using fastener c/w \n25 mm embossed washer\nRoof Cladding\nUnderlay laid over\nnetting or mesh\nPosition purlin\nto take fastener\nthrough leading\nedge of apron\nflashing\nUB rafter\nMasonry \nfasteners \nat 900\ncentres\nStop end\nroof sheet\nHST purlin\n200 min. \ncover\n20 mm\n\n8.5.4I Parapet - Reglet Flashing, Face Fixed\nClosed cell self\nadhesive foam\nMS Sealant (Grey)\n45 deg Angle\n8.5.4.1 \nParapet And Apron Capping Terminations \nA junction where an apron flashing meets a ridge can be weathered by two methods.\n1.

This movement causes noise and deterioration of the coating. A separate apron flashing as\nshown in 8.5.4.2A Change of Pitch Junction Flashing is required to prevent that.\nA junction flashing must be used where sheeting is cut at a change of pitch. The junction must be hooked and\nhave the minimum coverage as required according to the exposure category in 8.4.4 Flashing Laps. The\nunderlay must overlap the flashing as shown.\nStep Apron \nA step apron or waterfall flashing must be used where the length of roof cladding is more than can be\ntransported, or exceeds the recommended length for expansion as shown in 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion\nProvisions.\nThe designer should allow a minimum 20 mm step in the purlin height to accommodate a step apron, giving a\ntotal change of height equal to 20 mm plus the profile height. The purlin height can be adjusted at the purlin cleat\nor by using a different size purlin. \n8.5.4.2A Change of Pitch Junction\nFlashing\n8.5.4.2B Change of Pitch Flashing\nDetails\nStop-end\nEnsure separation\nbetween sheet end\nand flashing\n\n8.5.4.3A Step Apron Details\n250mm min.cover\nFasteners c/w\n25mm embossed washer\nProfile washer\nStop end sheets\nRoof profile\nUnderlay\nCleats extended by profile\ndepth + 10mm\nUniversal Beam\nSize of purlin span to\nsuit end condition\n8.5.4.3B Stepped Roof Flashing\nFoam Closure\n320mm\n300mm\n200\n15 -20\nSheet stop end\nProfile depth\n+ 15 - 20mm\n220mm\nHeight of step = Profile height + 20mm\nFix with self-\ndrilling 12g x \n25 type 17\nscrews\nEaves Flashing \nGutter eaves flashings are not required for weatherproofing unless the building is in a very exposed\nlocation and the eaves are not protected by spouting. They can, however, serve a purpose in many\napplications of improving the durability of roofing at the eaves.\nThe flashing should extend into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the flashing. If there is\nno over flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm.\nUnwashed flashings should be made of durable materials such as organic coated steel, aluminium, or PVC.\nEaves flashings as referred to in E2/AS1 are not required for weatherproofing unless the eaves are unprotected by\nspouting, but they can make a contribution to durability.\nEaves flashings are recommended in Marine Environments to improve the durability of the roof cladding and are\nrequired for pre-painted aluminium roofs (see 14.9). Eaves flashings may be pre-painted steel or aluminium (either\npre-painted or uncoated). To minimise the build-up of salt deposits at the eaves, a high-fronted gutter fully\ncovering the roof crests, attached closely to the fascia, is recommended in Severe and Very Severe Marine\nenvironments.\n8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves Flashing Option 1\n\n8.5.4.4B Gutter-Eaves Flashing Option 2\nCurved Flashings \nDrape curved and crimp curved metal roof cladding requires curved barge and apron flashings which may not\nalways have an even radius.\nThere are two different ways to form curved flashings, all of which require specialist equipment.\nlock-forming or lock seaming; or\ncrimping.\nManufacturing curved flashings is a highly skilled operation and should be done in a factory by skilled workers.\n8.5.5.1 \nLockseamed Flashings \nAll lock-seamed flashings should be custom-made to suit the profile shape and the rib distance from the fascia\nwith sufficient downturn on both sides to weather the junction. Lock-seamed flashings are made in two parts, the\nhorizontal (part a) and the vertical (part b). Edges can be either crimped or lock-seamed, as shown in these\ndrawings.\n\n8.5.5.1A Lockseamed Curved Flashing\nThe vertical barge component (part b) can be cut to the curve and lock-seamed, with the horizontal component\n(part a) hooked and seamed jointed. (See 14.21 Tools Of The Trade.) The outside edge can be crimped as\nshown here, or hemmed.\nShallowly curved flashings can be folded straight in one piece and crimped on both edges. Fix the turn-down at\nthe curved rib by \"mini-crimping\" or \"gear-crimping\". \n8.5.5.2 \nCrimped Flashings \nCrimped flashings are suitable for use on radii of more than 2 m, with the crimp spaced and deformed at regularly\nspaced intervals. A flat strip should be placed on the template and crimped until the strip fits the template.\nBecause the flashings are seen from much closer, domestic clients may find this type of flashing\naesthetically unacceptable.\n8.5.5.2A Regularly Spaced Crimp (Crimp Flashing)\nFastening Flashings \nFlashings may be fastened in three ways:\nBy primary fastening - fastening into the main structure.\nBy secondary fastening - fastening into the cladding.\nBy means of clips, cleats or seams to allow for differential movement of the roof cladding and the\nflashings.\nIt is recommended for flashings-to-roof cladding that at least one row of fasteners goes into the primary\nstructure, and primary or secondary fasteners are applied close to all longitudinal edges.\nFor full details on fixings, see 14.12 Fasteners.\n8.6.1 \nPrimary Fasteners \nPrimary fasteners are fixings that attach flashings to the structural building frame and which should withstand all\nthe loads applied to the cladding, including expansion provisions. Primary fasteners are relied on for structural\nperformance. Flashings should be fastened at a point within 25 mm from the exposed edges of the flashing, and\nthe primary fastener spacing should be to each structural member it crosses.\nFlashings should be fixed on both edges.\nPutting bonded or embossed washers under all primary fasteners through the horizontal upper surface of\nflashings improves weathertightness.\n8.6.2 \nSecondary Fasteners \nSecondary fasteners are fixings that attach flashings to sheets and one another to transfer loads and provide lap\nsealing. Rivets and stitching screws are secondary fasteners used to fasten flashing laps. They are subject to\nshear loading due to expansion and differential movement.\nSealing washers are required on all secondary fasteners, except under rivets which should themselves be sealed\nor self-sealing.\n8.6.3 \nFlashing Cleats \nA flashing cleat is a continuous metal under-flashing installed behind the leading edge of a metal\ncapping or flashing. Cleats secure cladding or flashings to the substrate or structure using a slip\njoint or by crimping the leading edge of the flashing to the cleat.\nCleats and clips should be accurately aligned and clinched after fixing to avoid vibration or\nchatter, but should still allow for expansion of the flashing.\n\nCleats are fastened to the substrate using mechanical fasteners and should be made from the same\nmetal as the flashing or sheeting.\nTo allow for differential expansion and contraction, the flashing should be securely hooked to the drip edge of the\ncleat but should not be attached directly to it.\n8.6.3A Flashing Secured to a Cleat\nCleat\n15 mm\n10 mm\n8.6.4 \nSeams \nFlashings can be joined together by various types of seam to avoid a plain lap joint without sealant.\nIf the joint is likely to retain moisture and it is required to be sealed, the sealant should be\nintroduced into the joint before it is completed.\n8.6.4A Lap Seam\n8.6.4B Lock Seam\n\n8.6.4C Drive Cleat\n8.6.4D Soaker\n8.6.4E Standing Seam\n8.6.4F Single-lock Standing Seam\n\n8.6.4G Double-lock Standing Seam\n8.6.4H Pittsburgh Lock\nSealants \nSealants play an important part in cladding because AZ or paint coatings cannot be sealed using\nsolder.\nThe purpose of sealants used in the joints between metal roof and wall cladding and flashings is to\nprevent the entry of rain or snow and to exclude dirt, debris, and moisture by capillary action. They\nmay also have varying degrees of adhesive action.\nSealants are generally Neutral Cure silicone or Modified Silicone (MS) types. The latter is generally\npaintable. Proprietary self-adhesive tape sealants are also entering the market and give excellent\nperformance in certain conditions. Acid cure sealant, designed to bond to inert surfaces such as\nglass, must not be used.\nDesigns using sealants to seal sheet components must always include a mechanical fastening such as a\nscrew, rivet or a mechanical seam. \nGenerally, the function of a sealant is carried out by that sealant being sandwiched in the joint. In\nmost cases, the post application of sealant to the outside of a joint is both futile and unacceptable.\nThe sealant does not require significant total adhesive strength, but it should bond positively to\nboth surfaces as a continuous layer. To ensure complete sealant cure, the width of sealant in a lap\nshould not exceed 25 mm when compressed\n8.7.1 \nMethods Of Sealing \nThere are two main methods of sealing metal sheets - gun applied sealants and self-adhesive tapes.\nSealants should have a low resistance to compression so that metal sheets can be brought closely together by\ntheir fasteners and not held apart by the sealant.\n8.7.2 \nSurface Preparation \nFor adequate bonding, all surfaces must be clean, dry and free from contaminants, such as rolling oils, dirt or\ndust. \n8.7.3 \nSealant Extrusion And Placement \nSealant should be gun-applied in a continuous flow to provide a joint without gaps or voids. This will prevent the\nentry of both condensation from above and water drawn up by capillary action, either of which can cause metal\ncorrosion.\nAfter placing the sealant cartridge in the gun, the tapered nozzle should be cut with a sharp knife\nat an angle of 45 deg at a position which would provide a bead of sealant approximately 6 mm in\ndiameter.\n\n8.7.3A Applying Sealant\nSealed rivets are the preferred fastener. The stem holes of unsealed blind rivets must be sealed with silicone,\nwhich can attract dust and look unsightly.\nSealant should be placed in a continuous bead close to the weather end, covering any pre-drilled rivet holes. If a\ncomplete ring of sealant is applied around the fastener, an air pocket forms which compresses during tightening\nof fasteners. It can blow a channel, thus preventing an effective seal.\nThe best method for lap fabrication is.\nAssemble and drill the components. Rivets should be positioned at 50 mm spacings.\nSeparate the components and remove any drilling swarf.\nRemove any strippable film.\nClean the joint.\nApply a continuous sealant bead as described above.\nRelocate the components, align the holes and fasten.\nExternally seal the centre of all rivets if required.\nRemove surplus sealant after it has cured (not while uncured), to avoid smearing.\nWhen placing the overlapping sheet, care should be taken to avoid disturbing the sealant when fastening.\nExcess sealant should be removed with a plastic spatula or purpose made plastic scoop as excess sealant\ncollects dirt that is unsightly.\nVisible excess of sealant is not an acceptable trade practice.\nProfile Closures \nProfiled closures are available for all profiles. They are available in narrow tip (for going under the profile) or wide\ntip (for fitting over).\nA printable bulletin is available at: BPC01 Profiled Foam Closures.\nExtract:\n\"The NZMRM Metal Roof and Wall Cladding Code of Practice recommends profiled foam closures\nonly where required for weather tightness. This typically occurs around windows of wall cladding.\nAcceptable Solution E2/AS1 says profiled foam closures should not be used at the eaves.\"\nAs they restrict the free movement of air, their use should be restricted to where they are required for\nweatherproofing and appearance (such as scribers under window jamb flashings) or for maintaining positive\ninternal pressures, such as in building with a managed internal environment. Profiled closures should be of closed\ncell type, rather than bitumen impregnated.\nIn marine areas, corrosion is likely to initiate under apex flashings and under the eaves overhang, regardless of\nwhether profiled foam is used. A high fronted spouting is the best protection against the eaves corrosion. In very\nsevere cases, or where there is a gap between the back of the gutter and the fascia, an eaves flashing of durable\nmaterial (e.g., aluminium or plastic) can be used to prevent much of the salt build-up on the underside of the roof\ncladding. (See 8.5.4.4 Eaves Flashing)\n8.8A Narrow Tip Profiled Eaves\nClosure\n8.8B Wide Tip Profiled Eaves Closure\n\n8.8C Purlin-Fixed Profiled Eaves\nClosure\n8.8D Fascia-Fixed Profiled Eaves\nClosure\n8.8F Z-Type Wall Cladding Vermin\nClosure\nClosed cell tape\nCladding\nDPC\nFloor pad\nMax 8 mm gap\n\n8.8I Eaves Corrosion due to Low Fronted Gutters\nLow-fronted gutters in severe conditions will often lead to eaves corrosion\n8.8.1 \nSoft Edging \n8.8E Eaves Comb\nFor vermin control, a perforated scribed aluminium\nflashing or an eaves comb may be used.\n\nTo prevent the ingress of weather, dirt, or birds, it is common practice in New Zealand to close the openings\ncreated by the pan and ribs of profiled sheets using notched metal flashings or soft edging. Lead was the\ntraditional material for this application, but as it is incompatible with AZ coatings, soft aluminium edging or\nProprietary soft edging is available for corrugated and low trapezoidal profiles, consisting of an expandable\naluminium mesh with a flexible backer.\nAll soft-edged flashings should be primed and colour painted before installation - but the preferred option is for\nthe paint finish on soft edges to be factory painted under controlled conditions.\nSoft-edged flashings are available in a partially-backed form to facilitate passive ventilation at the apex. (See \nInternal Moisture)\n8.8.2 \nNotched Edging \nWhere the profile height exceeds 30 mm, a notched flashing is the preferred option.\nAll scribed edges should have clearance to avoid damaging the coating of the roof sheet. The scribed metal edge\nof any flashing must have a clearance of 2 mm to 5 mm.\n8.8G J-type Vermin Closure\nVented vermin strip\nMax 8mm gap\nFloor pad\nHorizontal \nCladding\nDPC\n8.8H L-type Vermin Closure\nmax 8mm gap\nCladding\nFloor pad\n3 - 5 mm gap or\nclosed cell tape\nCompression Timber \n8.9A Buckled Ridge Flashing\nBefore any transverse flashings are fixed, the framing timber must have a maximum moisture content below 18%.\nTransverse flashings, such as ridging, are sometimes prone to compressive buckling which is blamed on metal\nexpansion but is usually due to timber shrinkage, and a phenomenon known as compression timber.\n\n8.9B Compressed Timber\nCompression wood has a darker appearance in the early wood (summer) growth rings; to visually distinguish such\nseverity levels in sawn timber accurately requires microscopic identification. (Source: Rooflink)\nAbnormal growth causes this defect in timber, which can cause ten times more shrinkage than normal.\nIt is not easy to recognise compression timber visually and roofers are advised to measure the moisture content,\nparticularly of ridge purlins, before fixing. Framing timber must have a maximum moisture content of 12% before\nany transverse flashings are fixed.\nAlternatively, use steel top hat purlins.\nFlashing Expansion Details \nExpansion should be considered at the design stage, and the flashing details should be included in the working\ndrawings and tender documents. As flashings cannot move in the lateral direction without stress, they should\nhave some provision for longitudinal expansion when their length exceeds 18m or for lesser distances for visible\nflashings such as fascias and facades.\nWhen using an expansion joint, independence of movement should be assured by the omission of any fixing\nthrough both sides of the joint. Preferred and acceptable slip joint expansion details are shown in 8.10A Apron\nSlip-joint and 8.10B Ridge Slip-joint. Soaker expansion joints relying on sealant should not be used.\nSlip joints require sealants, not to make them weatherproof, but to exclude dust and dirt from two close-fitting\nsurfaces, which can retain moisture by capillary action and cause corrosion. Rivets and other fasteners must not\nprevent movement of the slip joint.\n8.10A Apron Slip-joint\n8.10B Ridge Slip-joint\nFlashing Expansion \nBefore any transverse flashings are fixed, the framing timber must have a maximum moisture content\nbelow 18%.\nTransverse flashings, such as ridging, are sometimes prone to excessive buckling, which is blamed on\nmetal expansion but is usually due to timber shrinkage and a phenomenon known as compression\ntimber. Abnormal growth causes this defect in timber, and it can shrink up to 10 times more than\nnormal. It is not easy to recognise compression timber, and roofers are advised to measure the moisture\ncontent, particularly of ridge purlins, before fixing.\nAn alternative is to use steel top hat purlins.\nFixing roof cladding should be treated in the same way as internal linings, i.e., do not fix transverse\nflashings when the moisture content of any timber is more than 18%. The thickness of flashings should\nalways comply as specified in 8.1 Flashing Materials\nIf flashings are positively fixed, framing timber that does not meet this requirement can cause\nfailure of ridging and flashings due to timber shrinkage when drying.\nThe metal expansion allowances quoted in many publications can be misleading because the\ninformation is based on theoretical metal expansion values and is not related to real-world\nconditions.\nFigures published for metal expansion rates are given linearly per degree, but it does not take into\naccount the many other factors that mitigate the theoretical figure. (See 7.3 Thermal Expansion\nAnd Contraction.) \nIt is necessary to make provision for cladding and flashing movement; when long lengths are used and positively\nscrewed or riveted together, they should be regarded as one length.\nThe maximum length before expansion provision should be made for either cladding or flashings will vary\naccording to colour, micro-climate, ventilation and fixing spacings. It is, however, possible to provide indicative\nfigures based on a study of empirical data over time. The maximum recommended flashing length without any\nexpansion provision is similar to that of roof cladding. (See 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion Provisions.)\nAluminium rivets, which have a low shear value, will fail when there is no provision made for expansion in flashing\nlengths of over 12 m. Using aluminium rivets is only acceptable if they are used at the prescribed distances, and\nare not used to replace expansion joints.\nLengths of coated steel ridging, cappings, and apron flashings over 12 m should have a slip joint as described in \n8.10 Flashing Expansion Details.\nInadequate provision for expansion can also cause roof noise.\n8.10.2 \nBuilding Expansion Joints \nExpansion joints should be designed to accommodate contraction and expansion. Expansion joints should be\ndetailed and constructed to a minimum height of 100 mm above the roof cladding, and curb-type expansion joints\nshould be designed and installed to ensure drainage of the roof and to prevent any damming of water.\n\nWood curbing secured to the substrate on both sides of an expansion joint should be flashed with a metal\ncapping capable of acting as an expansion joint cover.\nExpansion joints have two main designs.\n1. A 8.10.2A One-piece Expansion Joint to accommodate movement using a central bellows or roll that\nallows the flashing to be positively fixed on both sides.\n2. A two-piece design to accommodate movement by the use of hemmed edges, with sufficient clearance for the\nexpected movement.\n8.10.2A One-piece Expansion Joint\nOptional Bellows\n8.10.2B Two-piece Expansion Joint\nSealant\nBoth of these designs are shown as a parapet following the pitch of the roof. Where this is not the case, the top\nof flashing should have a 3 - 5 slope as for all other parapet flashings. (See 8.5.3 Parapet Cappings).\nMetal wall construction joint flashings that are embedded in the wall should be made with a bellows or other\nmeans of accommodating movement without fatigue and have a durability of 50 years.\nMetal Wall Cladding Flashings \nFlashing details for cladding using profiled metals should:\nhave two lines of defence at any point,\nnot rely entirely on sealant,\nnot unnecessarily bridge the cavity, and\ngive water a means of escape when it does get in.\nDetails from WANZ, cladding suppliers, or bespoke solutions may be used. In the case of bespoke solutions, it is\ncritical that the intersection of the different elements is considered holistically, particularly at the critical\nhead/jamb flashing intersection. Changing one element of a proprietary solution may have unconsidered\nramifications on the performance of other elements.",

In such cases, a clearance of 20 mm\nis sufficient to prevent contamination and prolonged wetness of the cladding.\nThe 5 mm clearance to inter-storey junctions and window heads is not achievable when the horizontal flashing\nhas a slope of 15 deg . The clearance at the back of the flashing/roof pan should be minimal, 2 - 5 mm, and the slope\nof the flashing should be decreased to minimise the clearance at the rib crest. For vermin proofing, the maximum\nclearance at the rib should be 8 mm.\nA printable bulletin is available at: BC01 Clearance between sheet ends\nand transverse flashings.\nExtract:\n\"The Metal Roofing and Wall Cladding Code of Practice (COP) stipulates clearance should be provided\nbetween the bottom edge of a profiled sheet and a transverse flashing, such as a change of pitch\nflashing. The purpose of such clearance is to prevent the end of the profiled sheet from damaging the\nprotective coating on the flashing, due to movement of the former from thermal expansion...\"\nRidging and Other Transverse Flashings \nA soft edge or notched flashing must be provided to transverse flashings. The positioning of the top purlin must\nbe adjusted with the pitch and the ridge girth to ensure that primary fastening is provided between 15 mm and 50\nmm from the leading edge of the flashing. See 8.4C Ridge and Head Flashing Cover.\n8.4.4 \nFlashing Laps \nLaps in flashings should comply with the following criteria:\nwater must flow over a lap, not into it,\na lap must not rely solely on sealant,\nsealed laps must be mechanically fixed at 50 mm centres,\nunsealed laps must have a minimum cover of 150 mm, and\na minimum of 100 mm cover is recommended for sealed laps to facilitate the correct alignment of two\nflashings.",

Having a clip fastened outer edge will minimise rippling of the face\nbut will not allow the free movement of a clip fastened option.\n1. The capping is fastened to the parapet on both sides using screws with embossed washers through oversized\nholes.\n2. A continuous cleat is fastened on the exterior face of the wall with an open hem at the drip for ease of\napplication. After the exterior face of the capping is hooked to the cleat, the capping on the interior side is\nsecured to the parapet using fasteners with embossed washers through oversized holes.\n\n3. Intermittent clips are fastened to the exterior face of the wall at 600 mm centres. All cleats and clips should be\naccurately aligned by string line during installation\n8.5.3E Fixed Cap to Concrete\n85 deg \nConcrete\nClearance\nClearance\nUnderlay\n8.5.3F Cap-fixed Parapet Cap to Smooth Profile Inner\n85 deg \nUnderlay\n\n8.5.3G Parapet Cap Fixed to Profiled Cladding\n85 deg \nUnderlay\nInstead of chasing into the wall or using a E Parapet Flashing - Face-Fixed, the preferred detail is to cover\nthe inside of the parapet wall with vertical ribbed metal or other cladding material, used in conjunction with an\napron flashing and parapet cap. (See 8.5.4B Vertical Cladding (Parapet Flashing and Detail))\nParapet Cap Slope\nParapet cappings that follow the slope of the roof do not require any fall across its width, but transverse parapet\ncappings must have a positive slope of onto the roof side to avoid ponding and encourage free draining. This\nslope should be 3 - 5 deg . Parapet cappings wider than 300 mm can fall both ways, with the drainage slope provided\non each side.\n\n8.5.3H Parapet-Roof Intersection\nHem\nLap\n8.5.4 \nApron Flashings \nCladding should not fit tightly onto the horizontal surface of any apron flashing; as it could retain moisture and\ncollect dirt and debris. It should have a minimum clearance of 25 mm to allow for cleaning and maintenance.\nApron flashings should be in position before the cladding is installed. Where replacement of the flashing requires\nremoval of the cladding above it, Figure 1 and Table 1 of B2/AS1 require the flashing to have a durability of 50\nyears. Durability can be achieved by using flashings made from non-ferrous materials. Alternatively, a 8.5.4F\nTwo-piece Apron should be used where the over-flashing has 50-year durability, and the apron flashing can be\nrenewed independently.\nWhen the parapet walls will be plastered or when other trades are likely to follow the roof cladding installation,\nthe roof cladding, and flashings should be protected from damage. Provision should also be made for working\nand walking on the roof cladding during this time.\nWhere an apron abuts a block, brick, or concrete wall without any cladding above it, the apron flashing can be\nweathered by a step or a continuous chased flashing. These flashings can be made from aluminium, stainless\nsteel, or zinc when used with metallic-coated steels and should extend 25 mm into the wall. They should be\nhooked or mechanically wedged and should be sealed using a compatible, flexible mortar or sealant. Over-clad\nflashings give better weather protection than chase-cut flashings.\n\n8.5.4A Chased Apron\n8.5.4B Vertical Cladding (Parapet Flashing and Detail)\n\n8.5.4C Angle Diverter\nDiverter\nStop end\n8.5.4D Angled Apron - 110 deg \nStop end\n8.5.4E Angled Apron - 45 deg \nStop end\n\n8.5.4F Two-piece Apron\n8.5.4A Chased Apron and 8.5.4C Angle Diverter are not the preferred installation methods for apron\nflashings. 8.5.4B Vertical Cladding (Parapet Flashing and Detail)shows a better method that provides\nmore positive weathering by covering the wall with vertical metal cladding up to the capping.\nIt is not possible to ensure that all the water discharged from the apron flashing will be collected by the spouting,\nunless special provisions are made including:\nan angle diverter should be sealed and fastened to the apron. (See 8.5.4C Angle Diverter);\nthe side apron flashing can be folded to 110 deg ( see 8.5.4D Angled Apron - 110 deg );\nan apron internal angle flashing can be folded to two angles at 135 deg (See 8.5.4E Angled Apron - 45 deg ); or\nusing a two-piece apron (See 8.5.4F Two-piece Apron).\nSpouting should be fitted after the wall has been finished and should be clear of the wall cladding.\nAprons should be stop-ended and turned down to weather and bird-proof the end of the apron at this junction.\nWhen flashing a cavity parapet, the apron should be in place before the cavity batten as it is not possible to\nretrofit the apron. The apron material should have a 50-year durability unless the parapet cladding is easy to\nreplace.\nWhen a chase or rebate (8.5.4G Chase-fixed Flashing) is not provided, a pressure bar flashing can be used\nto weather an apron flashing into a concrete tilt-up slab wall. \n\n8.5.4G Chase-fixed Flashing\nPolysulphide \nsealand\n80 deg \n20\n10mm\n110mm\nNon-\nferrous\nBacking rod\nSealant\nDepth of\nflashing into\npanel\nOver-clad apron flashings are always preferred to chase-cut alternatives in structures such as residences where\nthe occurrence of chase-cut weatherproofing failure could have severe consequences.\n\n8.5.4H Parapet - Reglet Flashing, Chase Cut\nDetail of Sealing Flashing\nPF Backer Rod\nMS Sealant\nFix head flashing to top\npurlin using fastener c/w \n25 mm embossed washer\nRoof Cladding\nUnderlay laid over\nnetting or mesh\nPosition purlin\nto take fastener\nthrough leading\nedge of apron\nflashing\nUB rafter\nMasonry \nfasteners \nat 900\ncentres\nStop end\nroof sheet\nHST purlin\n200 min. \ncover\n20 mm\n\n8.5.4I Parapet - Reglet Flashing, Face Fixed\nClosed cell self\nadhesive foam\nMS Sealant (Grey)\n45 deg Angle\n8.5.4.1 \nParapet And Apron Capping Terminations \nA junction where an apron flashing meets a ridge can be weathered by two methods.\n1. By carrying the apron over the ridge and covering the joint with the ridging as shown in 8.5.4.1A\nParapet/Apron Ridge Cap.\n2. By making a separate saddle flashing as shown in 8.5.4.1B Separate Saddle Flashing.\n\n8.5.4.1A Parapet/Apron Ridge Cap\n8.5.4.1B Separate Saddle Flashing\n\n8.5.4.1C Corner Abutment\nParapet cappings should have a separate cap at the apex or be joined as shown in 8.5.4.1D One-piece Parapet\nRidge.\n8.5.4.1D One-piece Parapet Ridge\n\n8.5.4.1E Two-Piece Parapet Ridge\n8.5.4.2 \nChange Of Pitch \nDifferential movement will happen at any change of roof cladding pitch where the sheets are overlapped and\nbutted together. This movement causes noise and deterioration of the coating. A separate apron flashing as\nshown in 8.5.4.2A Change of Pitch Junction Flashing is required to prevent that.\nA junction flashing must be used where sheeting is cut at a change of pitch. The junction must be hooked and\nhave the minimum coverage as required according to the exposure category in 8.4.4 Flashing Laps. The\nunderlay must overlap the flashing as shown.\nStep Apron \nA step apron or waterfall flashing must be used where the length of roof cladding is more than can be\ntransported, or exceeds the recommended length for expansion as shown in 7.3.2 Roof Cladding Expansion\nProvisions.\nThe designer should allow a minimum 20 mm step in the purlin height to accommodate a step apron, giving a\ntotal change of height equal to 20 mm plus the profile height. The purlin height can be adjusted at the purlin cleat\nor by using a different size purlin. \n8.5.4.2A Change of Pitch Junction\nFlashing\n8.5.4.2B Change of Pitch Flashing\nDetails\nStop-end\nEnsure separation\nbetween sheet end\nand flashing\n\n8.5.4.3A Step Apron Details\n250mm min.cover\nFasteners c/w\n25mm embossed washer\nProfile washer\nStop end sheets\nRoof profile\nUnderlay\nCleats extended by profile\ndepth + 10mm\nUniversal Beam\nSize of purlin span to\nsuit end condition\n8.5.4.3B Stepped Roof Flashing\nFoam Closure\n320mm\n300mm\n200\n15 -20\nSheet stop end\nProfile depth\n+ 15 - 20mm\n220mm\nHeight of step = Profile height + 20mm\nFix with self-\ndrilling 12g x \n25 type 17\nscrews\nEaves Flashing \nGutter eaves flashings are not required for weatherproofing unless the building is in a very exposed\nlocation and the eaves are not protected by spouting. They can, however, serve a purpose in many\napplications of improving the durability of roofing at the eaves.\nThe flashing should extend into the gutter, and the underlay finishes on the down-slope of the flashing. If there is\nno over flashing to the gutter, the underlay should be extended into the gutter by a maximum of 20 mm.\nUnwashed flashings should be made of durable materials such as organic coated steel, aluminium, or PVC.\nEaves flashings as referred to in E2/AS1 are not required for weatherproofing unless the eaves are unprotected by\nspouting, but they can make a contribution to durability.\nEaves flashings are recommended in Marine Environments to improve the durability of the roof cladding and are\nrequired for pre-painted aluminium roofs (see 14.9). Eaves flashings may be pre-painted steel or aluminium (either\npre-painted or uncoated). To minimise the build-up of salt deposits at the eaves, a high-fronted gutter fully\ncovering the roof crests, attached closely to the fascia, is recommended in Severe and Very Severe Marine\nenvironments.\n8.5.4.4A Gutter-Eaves Flashing Option 1\n\n8.5.4.4B Gutter-Eaves Flashing Option 2\nCurved Flashings \nDrape curved and crimp curved metal roof cladding requires curved barge and apron flashings which may not\nalways have an even radius.\nThere are two different ways to form curved flashings, all of which require specialist equipment.\nlock-forming or lock seaming; or\ncrimping.\nManufacturing curved flashings is a highly skilled operation and should be done in a factory by skilled workers.\n8.5.5.1 \nLockseamed Flashings \nAll lock-seamed flashings should be custom-made to suit the profile shape and the rib distance from the fascia\nwith sufficient downturn on both sides to weather the junction. Lock-seamed flashings are made in two parts, the\nhorizontal (part a) and the vertical (part b). Edges can be either crimped or lock-seamed, as shown in these\ndrawings.\n\n8.5.5.1A Lockseamed Curved Flashing\nThe vertical barge component (part b) can be cut to the curve and lock-seamed, with the horizontal component\n(part a) hooked and seamed jointed. (See 14.21 Tools Of The Trade.) The outside edge can be crimped as\nshown here, or hemmed.\nShallowly curved flashings can be folded straight in one piece and crimped on both edges. Fix the turn-down at\nthe curved rib by \"mini-crimping\" or \"gear-crimping\". \n8.5.5.2 \nCrimped Flashings \nCrimped flashings are suitable for use on radii of more than 2 m, with the crimp spaced and deformed at regularly\nspaced intervals. A flat strip should be placed on the template and crimped until the strip fits the template.\nBecause the flashings are seen from much closer, domestic clients may find this type of flashing\naesthetically unacceptable.\n8.5.5.2A Regularly Spaced Crimp (Crimp Flashing)",

Where replacement of the flashing requires\nremoval of the cladding above it, Figure 1 and Table 1 of B2/AS1 require the flashing to have a durability of 50\nyears. Durability can be achieved by using flashings made from non-ferrous materials. Alternatively, a 8.5.4F\nTwo-piece Apron should be used where the over-flashing has 50-year durability, and the apron flashing can be\nrenewed independently.\nWhen the parapet walls will be plastered or when other trades are likely to follow the roof cladding installation,\nthe roof cladding, and flashings should be protected from damage. Provision should also be made for working\nand walking on the roof cladding during this time.\nWhere an apron abuts a block, brick, or concrete wall without any cladding above it, the apron flashing can be\nweathered by a step or a continuous chased flashing. These flashings can be made from aluminium, stainless\nsteel, or zinc when used with metallic-coated steels and should extend 25 mm into the wall. They should be\nhooked or mechanically wedged and should be sealed using a compatible, flexible mortar or sealant. Over-clad\nflashings give better weather protection than chase-cut flashings.",

It should have a minimum clearance of 25 mm to allow for cleaning and maintenance.\nApron flashings should be in position before the cladding is installed. Where replacement of the flashing requires\nremoval of the cladding above it, Figure 1 and Table 1 of B2/AS1 require the flashing to have a durability of 50\nyears. Durability can be achieved by using flashings made from non-ferrous materials. Alternatively, a 8.5.4F\nTwo-piece Apron should be used where the over-flashing has 50-year durability, and the apron flashing can be\nrenewed independently.\nWhen the parapet walls will be plastered or when other trades are likely to follow the roof cladding installation,\nthe roof cladding, and flashings should be protected from damage. Provision should also be made for working\nand walking on the roof cladding during this time.\nWhere an apron abuts a block, brick, or concrete wall without any cladding above it, the apron flashing can be\nweathered by a step or a continuous chased flashing. These flashings can be made from aluminium, stainless\nsteel, or zinc when used with metallic-coated steels and should extend 25 mm into the wall. They should be\nhooked or mechanically wedged and should be sealed using a compatible, flexible mortar or sealant. Over-clad\nflashings give better weather protection than chase-cut flashings.",

Changing one element of a proprietary solution may have unconsidered\nramifications on the performance of other elements.",
