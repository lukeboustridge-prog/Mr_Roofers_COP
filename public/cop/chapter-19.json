Although a fall of 5mm in 1m may improve self-cleaning and drainage, it may have an\nundesireable visual outcome.\nOur recommendations for making provision for expansion in aluminium were updated in both 7.3.2 Roof\nCladding Expansion Provisions and 14.19.2 Recommendations for Fixing Aluminium to be less\nrestrictive.\n17.1 Metal Cladding Testing was revised to improve understanding of testing requirements. These\nchanges only affect how MRM members will publish testing results, not testing procedures.\nThe entire clause 15.3 Pressed Metal Tiles was revised and edited, with some information being updated.\n15.5 Warm Roofs were similarly revised and edited. Although there were no substantial changes to\nrecommendations, the content was updated to reflect more modern techniques and approaches.\nThe revision of Warm Roofs included updated details for 15.5.1.18B Insulated Panels Barge Flashing.\nOther Edits and revisions\nThe rest of this update is taken up with minor edits and revisions for clarity, grammar, and spelling.\nImportant Notice:\nIn a move to help us better understand our audience and make the NZMRM Metal and Wall Roof Cladding Code\nof Practice even more useful and relevant, we are introducing an industry selector to the existing registration\nform. If your particular industry is not listed please select one that is closest.\nRegistration is important so everybody will be informed of important revisions which is done on a quarterly\nschedule.

Minor edits were made for grammar, style, clarity, and consistency.\nNotable revisions:\nWe removed the option of 0.70 mm Aluminium cladding from 3.11.3 Aluminium Cladding Wind Load\nSpan Graphs because 0.90 mm Aluminium is offered as a standard thickness.\nExperience showed that hot-dipped galvanised gutter support brackets are not as durable as pre-painted steel\nproducts.
