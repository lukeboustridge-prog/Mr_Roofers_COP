The type of penetration design is determined by:\nthe size of the hole,\nshape,\nthe roof pitch,\nthe type of roof,\nthe catchment area,\nplacement on the roof, and\naesthetic requirements.\nDesigners are urged to consider what type of penetration design matches the building application and their\ncustomer's needs, and detail accordingly, rather than allow the installer to make an on-site decision.\nSee it in action with Roofguide\nMany of the penetration details in the Code of Practice are expanded on with step-by-step, interactive 3D\ninstructions in the RANZ Roofing Guide, developed by the Roofing Association of New Zealand in\nassociation with the NZMRM.\nWorks on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.\n\nFind out more at www.roofguide.co.nz\nPenetrations Minimum Pitch\nPenetrations may be executed in roofs of any pitch down to the minimum pitch allowed for that profile.\nPenetrations are allowed in the portion of curved roofs where the pitch falls below these limits, providing the\npenetration flashing bridges the apex and terminates where the pitch is a minimum of 3 deg .\nAdditional Support\nTerminating a sheet above and below a penetration creates an end span situation and sheet support and fastener\npatterns should be checked accordingly, or additional support must be provided. (See 3.5.1.1 Continuity.)\nPenetrations requiring removal of a roof section greater than 300 mm x 300 mm require additional supporting\nframework. Ideally this should be in position before the roof cladding is fixed; alternatively, the supporting\nframework should be in position before cutting a hole in the cladding.\nThe additional support for larger penetrations must have the same strength as the adjacent purlins. Purlins and\nthe support structure must be designed to take the additional weight of any plant exceeding 100 kg.

Penetrations can be broadly put into two categories: Sheetmetal flashings and Boot\nflashings.\nThe positioning of the penetration in relation to the apex, eaves and other architectural features must be taken\ninto consideration when selecting the type of flashing to be employed.\n9.4A Recommended Penetration Type Positioning\nNarrow:\nLevel Back Kerb\nClose to Ridge:\nOverflashing\nDistant From Ridge:\nSoaker\nClose to Eave:\nHidden Gutter\nWide: Cricket\nBack Kerb\nMedium:\nArrowhead Back\nKerb\nSee it in action with Roofguide\nMany of the penetration details in the Code of Practice are expanded on with step-by-step, interactive 3D\ninstructions in the RANZ Roofing Guide, developed by the Roofing Association of New Zealand in\nassociation with the NZMRM.\nWorks on desktops, laptops, tablets and phones.\nFind out more at www.roofguide.co.nz\n9.4.1\nPenetration Back Flashings\n\nThe first decision should be the back flashing, should it be over the profile 9.4.1.1 Overflashed (Watershed)\nBackflashings or under the profile 9.4.1.2 Under-Soaker Back Flashings.\n9.4.1.1\nOverflashed (Watershed) Backflashings\nThe maximum width of a watershed flashing manufactured in one piece is controlled by the coil width of 1.2m.\nThe practice of making wider watershed flashings by running sheets horizontally with laps at 1.1m (\"lobster\nback\") is allowable depending on circumstances.\nFactors which may encourage the use of lobster back over-flashings include:\nIs the pitch very low, making an underflashing hard to make watertight?\nIs it unseen from the ground?\nIs the roof in place before creating the penetration?\nWill there be little or no foot traffic on the flashing?\nThe weathertightness of lobster-back flashings can be made more secure by using good technique, particularly by\nsupporting the flashing seams where they span the pan of the profile by putting high-density polystyrene or similar\nin the pans. The number of rivets required can also be reduced by sealing the joints with Extra Heavy Duty double-\nsided tape.

They are\nrelatively easy and economical to install at the time of roof laying, but more difficult and costlier if post\ninstallation is required.\n9.4.2\nCurb Design\nCurb design (i.e., level, arrowhead, or cricket) depends largely on the penetration width and the expected amount\nof debris, e.g., tree leaves. Proximity to the apex determines penetration flashing design (i.e., over flashing, under-\nsoaker, or hidden gutter).\n9.4.2.1\nLevel Back Curbs\nLevel back curbs are the most common solution for flashing penetrations and are the easiest to fabricate and\ninstall.\nThey may tend to collect debris as they have little or no transverse fall, which can limit durability. However, with\nnormal maintenance when manufactured from the same material as the roof they should achieve the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC.\nFor penetrations wider than 600 mm, or those in aggressive environments or in situations where maintenance is\ndifficult, a freer draining design such as an arrowhead or cricket is preferable.\n9.4.2.2\nArrowhead Back Curbs\nArrowhead back curbs have a diverter that provides transverse fall for diverting rainwater, enabling them to\naccommodate bigger catchment areas and self-cleanse. They have a small flat area at the base of the arrowhead\nthat may require maintenance.\n9.4.2.3\nCricket Back Curbs\nCricket back curbs divert water with less turbulence than either arrowhead or flat back curbs and have no flat\nareas to catch debris. They may be fabricated from the same material as the roof or welded from 1.6 mm\naluminium and powder-coated to match the roof colour, to give a durable and matching solution.

online tool for calculating Maximum Area Above Penetrations is available\nat https://www.metalroofing.org.nz/maximum-area-above-penetration-calculator.\nBoot Flashings\nA boot flashing is a proprietary EPDM flashing designed to weatherproof cylindrical penetrations protruding from\na roof or wall. The top is trimmed to form a tight weatherproof collar around the penetration, and the base is\nformed with a series of concentric rings to the underside and a malleable stiffener of aluminium which is dressed\nto conform to the shape of the roofing profile. It is generally top-fixed to the roof surface with screws or rivets,\nand sealant.\nThe Profiled Metal Roofing COP allows pipe penetration flashings to be fitted directly to the profile or on to an\nover flashing. Pitch limitations depend on the method used and the cladding profile.\nDirect-fixed options are pitch sensitive. When laid directly on to the profile at too low a pitch, they will entrap\nwater rather than allow it to discharge over the profile crests that they traverse. The practical limits of direct-fixed\nboot flashings that cross an entire pan are 8 deg for standard corrugated and 10 deg for low rib trapezoidal products.\nWhere the base of a boot does not obstruct a pan it can be direct-fixed to the minimum pitch for that profile.\nDirect fixed applications for high rib trapezoidal profiles and trough sections vary according to the profile, and the\nsize and position of the penetration. For these applications, the manufacturer should be consulted or the flashing\ncan be attached to an over flashing, or a top fixed soaker type can be used.\nWhere the penetration is wide such as a chimney flue casing, and the penetration is far from the apex, soaker\nflashings may be used where the profile ribs are cut back so water can divert into the adjacent pan.\nWhere overall width is not a constraint, directly fixed boot flashings should be installed with their edges diagonal\nto the fall of water. Where this is not practical, they may be laid square at pitches of 10 deg or more.\n9.5A Square-Fixed Over-Fitted Boot\nWhere boot flashings traverse a lap, the lap must be fully sealed or other actions must be taken to avoid leaks\nthrough capillary action. Where possible the fixing of a boot flashing over a lap should be avoided\nThe vertical sections of a boot flashing must not constrict the free flow of water. Where more than 50% blockage\nof the pan occurs other penetrations must be considered, or catchment calculations of the capacity of the\nremaining pan area should be made.

Typically, this is 8 deg for standard corrugated, and 3 deg for trapezoidal and trough sections. These boot\nflashings must be fixed diagonally to the fall of the roof at pitches below 10 deg .\nOver flashings can be continuous to the apex, or terminate with a soaker at the upper edge.\n\n9.5.1A Over-Flashed Boot Flashing on Corrugated Profile\nFit over flashing\nto be supported\nby roof sheets\nCentre flashing with\nminimum of two crests\neither side of diameter\nof pipe\nFall\nCut sheets to\nclosely fit\npipe and\nstop end\nFit EPDM boot flashing on\ndiagonal.

It is not acceptable to exit cables through a vertical flashing\nsuch as a boot flashing where sealant is the only barrier to water leakage.\n\n9.5.2.1A PVC and E.P.D.M Flashing\nThis flashing should be fixed next to the purlin for support.\nSafety bollards for fall arrest anchorages are required where regular maintenance is required, and these can also\nbe weathered by E.P.D.M. flashings.\n9.5.2.2\nMechanical Services\nWhere plant room supports are required to penetrate the roof cladding, the designer should provide the support\nframing from Circular Hollow Sections (CHS) in preference to Rectangular Hollow Sections (RHS) or other hot\nrolled steel sections, because it is easy to flash the CRS with E.P.D.M. flashings. This procedure allows the\nE.P.D.M. flashings to be slid over the pipe framing during erection, and avoid the necessity of using retrofitting\ntypes.\nThe support framing should be in place, but below the top of the purlin, before installing the roof cladding. That\nallows the cladding installation to proceed without having to weatherproof multiple penetrations at the same\ntime.\n\n9.5.2.2A Support Framing\nProprietary support systems are available for lightweight support through to the purlins.\n9.5.2.2B Lightweight Support Frame\nThese types of supports provide clearance for cleaning, but should not create an unwashed area underneath\nthem.\n9.5.3\nFlush Penetrations\n\nPenetrations such as roof windows may be mounted flush with the crests of the roofing profile.

flashing designed to weatherproof cylindrical penetrations protruding from\na roof or wall. The top is trimmed to form a tight weatherproof collar around the penetration, and the base is\nformed with a series of concentric rings to the underside and a malleable stiffener of aluminium which is dressed\nto conform to the shape of the roofing profile. It is generally top-fixed to the roof surface with screws or rivets,\nand sealant.\nThe Profiled Metal Roofing COP allows pipe penetration flashings to be fitted directly to the profile or on to an\nover flashing. Pitch limitations depend on the method used and the cladding profile.\nDirect-fixed options are pitch sensitive. When laid directly on to the profile at too low a pitch, they will entrap\nwater rather than allow it to discharge over the profile crests that they traverse. The practical limits of direct-fixed\nboot flashings that cross an entire pan are 8 deg for standard corrugated and 10 deg for low rib trapezoidal products.\nWhere the base of a boot does not obstruct a pan it can be direct-fixed to the minimum pitch for that profile.\nDirect fixed applications for high rib trapezoidal profiles and trough sections vary according to the profile, and the\nsize and position of the penetration. For these applications, the manufacturer should be consulted or the flashing\ncan be attached to an over flashing, or a top fixed soaker type can be used.\nWhere the penetration is wide such as a chimney flue casing, and the penetration is far from the apex, soaker\nflashings may be used where the profile ribs are cut back so water can divert into the adjacent pan.\nWhere overall width is not a constraint, directly fixed boot flashings should be installed with their edges diagonal\nto the fall of water. Where this is not practical, they may be laid square at pitches of 10 deg or more.\n9.5A Square-Fixed Over-Fitted Boot\nWhere boot flashings traverse a lap, the lap must be fully sealed or other actions must be taken to avoid leaks\nthrough capillary action. Where possible the fixing of a boot flashing over a lap should be avoided\nThe vertical sections of a boot flashing must not constrict the free flow of water. Where more than 50% blockage\nof the pan occurs other penetrations must be considered, or catchment calculations of the capacity of the\nremaining pan area should be made.

This procedure allows the\nE.P.D.M. flashings to be slid over the pipe framing during erection, and avoid the necessity of using retrofitting\ntypes.\nThe support framing should be in place, but below the top of the purlin, before installing the roof cladding.
