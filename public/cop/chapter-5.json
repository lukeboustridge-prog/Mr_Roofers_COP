As the design considerations are similar, this also includes the discharge from gutters and troughs\nwithin the roof plane, valleys, internal gutters, and external spouting.\nThe Roof Drainage section gives guidance for compliance with NZBC Clause E1 Surface Water. It describes how\nto drain rainwater effectively from roofs and gutters.\nThe Code of Practice provides several interactive calculators:\n5A Capacity Calculations\nGutter Capacity\n5.4.7 Gutter Capacity Calculator\nValley Capacity (both symmetrical and\nasymmetrical)\n5.5.7 Valley Capacity Calculator\nDownpipe Capacity\n5.7.3 Downpipe Capacity Calculator\nMaximum Area Above Spreaders\n5.8.1 Maximum Area Above Spreader\nCalculator\nMaximum Area Above Penetrations\n9.4.4 Maximum Area Above Penetration\nCalculator\nMaximum Run\n7.1.4 Maximum Run Calculator\n 5 \n 5ACAPACITY CALCULATIONS\n 5 \n 5A\n169\n\n5.1 \nNZBC: Clause E1 - Surface Water \nObjective\nSafeguard people from injury or illness, and property from damage, caused by surface water\nFunctional Requirement\nBuildings and sitework shall be constructed in a way that protects people and other property from the adverse\neffect of Surface Water.\nPerformance\nSurface water from an event that has 10% probability of occurring annually that is collected or concentrated by\nbuildings, shall be disposed of in a way that avoids damage or nuisance to other property.\nSurface water resulting from an event with a 2% probability of occurring annually shall not enter buildings.\n 5 \n 5.1 NZBC: CLAUSE E1 - SURFACE WATER\nRoof Drainage Terminology \n5.2A Roof Drainage Terminology as used in the COP\nTerminologyUsage in the Code of Practice\nFreeboard\nThe height of the watertight portion of a gutter or profile above the design water\nlevel at maximum rain intensity. This is to allow for wave action or\nimpediments in the sole of the channel that may otherwise cause overflowing.\nGutter\nA channel formed to collect and carry water away from a roof, variously\ndescribed as internal, external, box, eaves, valley, secret, hidden, and raking.\nSpouting specifically refers to an external gutter.\nHidden\nGutter\nAn internal gutter that runs parallel to the roof pitch. This is commonly found\nbeside penetrations positioned close to the eaves.\nInternal\nGutter\nA gutter inside the building envelope. In the COP terminology, this applies\nspecifically to those that run transverse to the roof pitch. See also Hidden Gutter,\nSecret Gutter.\nRaking\nSpouting\nSpouting that runs at an oblique angle to the roof.\nSecret\nGutter\nAn internal gutter that runs at an oblique angle to the roof pitch. This is\ncommonly found where a roof runs into a raking wall or barge.\nRoof Drainage Design \nThe objective of roof drainage systems is to maintain a weatherproof building, to minimise the risk\nof injury or inconvenience due to flooding, and to avoid potential monetary loss and property\ndamage - including to the contents of buildings.\nRoof drainage design requires consideration of:\nType of gutter (external, internal, valley, or roof gutter),,\nrainfall intensity,\ncatchment area,\ngutter fall,\ngutter-cross-sectional area and wetted surface area, and\noutlet and downpipe capacity.\nThis section details specific requirements for the sizing of all drainage components.\n5.3.1 \nCatchment Area \nThe effective catchment area for a gutter is determined not only by the plane area of the roof itself but also by the\nwalls adjacent to the roof. When a wall is discharging on to a roof, half the surface area of that wall (up to a\nmaximum height of 10 m), must be added to the catchment calculation.\n5.3.1.1 \nRoof Pitch \nThe COP calculations are based on the plane area of the roof (which is the sloping surface area of the roof), not\nthe plan area (which is the area covered by the roof).\n\n5.3.1.1A Plane Area vs Plan Area\nPlan Area\nPlane Area\nWind action can influence effective catchment area, and the COP assumes the worst case scenario, i.e., rain\nstriking the roof at an angle perpendicular to the roof plane.\n5.3.2 \nRainfall Intensity \nRainfall intensity can be taken off the maps for 50-year average return intervals (ARI). When the co-ordinates of a\nsite are known, site-specific values can be obtained using NIWA's HIRDS tool at https://hirds.niwa.co.nz/\nAs NZBC E1 requires that rainwater from events having 2% likelihood of occurring annually shall\nnot enter buildings, the COP uses figures for 50-year Average Return Interval, rather than the 10%\nprobability figures published in E1/AS1.\n\n5.3.2A Comparison of 10-year and 50-year Rainfall Intensities\nWhangarei\nAuckland\nTauranga\nHamilton\nWellington\nGreymouth\nChristchurch\nDunedin\nQueenstown\n10-Year return\n50-Year Return\n\n5.3.2B North Island 10 Minute Rainfall Intensity Map: 50 Year ARI\n\n5.3.2C South Island 10 Minute Duration Rainfall Intensity: 50-year ARI\nHaast\nMilford Sound\nArthur's Pass\nOwaka\nOAMARU\nTIMARU\nAkaroa\nPicton\nNELSON\nDUNEDIN\nWaimate\nReefton\nMotueka\nHokitika\nKaikoura\nWestport\nBLENHEIM\nBalclutha\nASHBURTON\nGreymouth\nQueenstown\nINVERCARGILL\nCHRISTCHURCH\nmm /hr\nDisclaimer:\nNIWA have prepared this map exercising all reasonable skill and care.\nNevertheless, NIWA can give no warranty that the map is free from errors,\nomissions or other inaccuracies.

The HIRDS tool shows figures for historical\nrainfall intensities and predicted rainfall based on the anticipated effects of climate change, expressed as\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCP) levels.\nThe increased rainfall intensity in a worst-case scenario is typically 11 - 13% higher than historical levels, mostly\noccurring under the least intense (RCP 2.6) value. To ensure design calculations account for expected climate\nchange, use the most appropriate RCP level.\n\n5.3.2.1A RCP Level Descriptions\nRating\nDescription\nRCP 2.6 A very stringent pathway that assumes CO2 levels peak at 2020 and go to zero by 2100.\nRCP4.5\nAn intermediate scenario where CO2 levels peak by 2040, then decline due to the\ndecreased availability of fossil fuels.\nRCP 6.0 A stabilisation scenario, where CO2 emissions peak around 2080, then decline with the\ndeployment of various technologies and strategies.\nRCP 8.5 Worst-Case scenario where CO2 emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century.\nThought by some to be based on an overestimation of projected coal outputs.\n5.3.2.2 \nDuration \nRainfall intensity figures quoted on the NIWA site are for maximum intensity over a ten-minute duration. Intensity\nmay vary within this period, and roof drains can overflow quickly when demand exceeds capacity. A 1-minute\nrainfall intensity can be as much as 4.2 times higher than the 10-minute intensity.\n5.3.2.1B Example of RCP Values for\nRandomly Selected Locations\nLocation\nHistoricRCP\n2.6\nRCP\n4.5\nRCP\n6.0\nRCP\n8.5\n%\nchange\nWhangarei\n137\n147 150 149 152 11\nAuckland\nCentral\n121\n131 133 132 135 12\nMt\nMaunganui\n149\n161 164 163 167 12\nWaikanae\n107\n116 118 117 120 12\nChristchurch55\nDunedin\nQueenstown 55\nHuntly\n126\n136 138 137 140 11\nNelson\n114\n124 126 125 128 12\nSilverdale\n124\n134 136 135 138 11\n Visit NIWA HIRDS-tool to get the corresponding values\nfor specific locations.\n5.3.2.1C Example of increasing ARI\nfigures Using RCP Values from Random\nLocations\nMt.

See 5.3.2.3A Short-Term Intensity\nMultiplication Factors.\n5.3.2.2A Comparison of 10-Minute Published Intensity with 1-Minute and 2-\nMinute Intensities\nRatio\nto 10\nmin\nmaximum\nrain rate\nDuration\n1min\n2min\nRain\nrate\nratio\nAverage\nRecurrence\nInterval\n(years)\nAllowance for Short-Term Intensities \nThe COP drainage calculator multiplies the ten-minute maximum intensity by a factor to allow for short-term\nfluctuations. This minimum factor varies by gutter location as follows.\n\n5.3.2.3A Short-Term Intensity Multiplication Factors\nApplication\nGutter Multiplier\nDownpipe Multiplier\nWith Overflow\nNo Overflow\nValleys\n3.1\nn/a\nn/a\nPenetrations\n3.1\nn/a\nn/a\nInternal Gutters Residential\nInternal Gutters Commercial\nExternal Gutters-no Overflow\nExternal Gutters-with Overflow\n5.3.2.3B Short-term Intensity Factor Explanation\nThese are minimum factors; higher factors may be applied at the designer's discretion.\nValleys, Penetrations, and Internal Gutters Residential have a minimum factor of 3.1 because failure of these\ngutters is likely to cause damage to internal elements. Where a 2% probability of flooding is unacceptable, a\nhigher figure should be used.\nInternal Gutters Commercial have a minimum factor of 2.2 as failure of these gutters is less likely to cause\nsevere damage and water run time may be longer. Short runs and steep pitches will reduce run time. (At\n250 mm/hr intensity and 3 degrees pitch, rain will take 2 minutes to travel 15 metres). For short runs, steeper\npitches and where the probability of flooding of 2% is unacceptable, a higher figure should be used.\nExternal Gutters no overflow have a minimum factor of 2.5, providing the building has a soffit. Otherwise, they\nshould be treated as an internal gutter.\nExternal Gutters with overflow have a minimum factor of 1, provided the building has a soffit, as occasional\noverflow is not likely to cause damage. To qualify as drained, the back of the gutter must be below the fascia\nheight and it must have a gap of at least 3 mm between the gutter and the fascia or cladding. This gap must be\nmaintained in all areas, including internal angles. External gutters to buildings without soffit must be provided\nwith a 10 mm drainage gap or be designed as an internal gutter.\nFor convenience, ARI maps are included in the calculation section which includes tables for gutter and valley\ncapacity for different rainfall intensities.\n5.3.3 \nMinimum Freeboard Values \nIn gutters where overflow can enter the structure, freeboard is necessary to allow for wave action, obstructions,\nand other unforeseen circumstances. Capacity Calculations allow for these minimum freeboard values.\n\n5.3.3A Minimum Freeboard Values\nGutter Type\nFreeboard\nInternal gutters\n30 mm\nSecret gutters\n15 mm\nValleys > 8 deg \n15 mm\nValleys < 8 deg \n20 mm\nAsymmetrical valleys\n20 mm\nExternal gutters with overflow\nNo freeboard required\nExternal gutters with no overflow\n15 mm\nGutters \nThe term \"gutters\" can be applied to all roof drains, but \"spouting\" refers specifically to external gutters.\nTypes of gutter:\nExternal gutters - positioned outside the building envelope.\nConcealed Fascia-Gutter Systems - gutters installed directly behind a fascia.\nInternal Gutters - formed inside a parapet wall or where two connected gables meet at an internal draining\npoint.\nValleys - where two roof planes meet at an angle of less than 180 deg .\nRoof Gutters - where a penetration obstructs and concentrates the flow of water, often into a single pan.\nSecret Gutters - where a roof discharges into a raked barge.\nThe definition of gutters in the COP includes the troughs of a profile adjacent to an obstruction (such as a\npenetration) or where a secret gutter is required, e.g., at the barge line of a Swiss Gable roof.\n5.4.1 \nExternal Gutters (Spouting) \nNZBC clause B2/AS1 requires spouting to have a durability of 5 years. In practice, this is rarely commercially\nacceptable. With sound design and reasonable maintenance, a spouting life of 10 years or more is usually\nachieved when using the same material as the profiled metal roof.\nSpouting that is difficult to access for replacement should be specified in more durable, compatible materials.\n5.4.1.1 \nBay Windows \nE1/AS1 does not prescribe a need for a building to have spouting, it merely requires that concentrations of water\ngathered by structures does not enter the building or cause damage or nuisance to other property. This is\ntraditionally achieved by using gutters and downpipes to discharge roof catchments into stormwater drains.\nMinor wall projections such as bay windows and boxed penetrations are treated as part of the wall catchment and\nare typically excused from requiring spouting and downpipe, provided the plan view surface area of individual\nprojections does not exceed 5 m2.\n5.4.1.2 \nOutbuildings \nSmall outbuildings such as garden sheds up to 10 are also traditionally exempted from requiring spouting and\ndownpipes providing the discharge does not interfere with neighbouring buildings.\n5.4.2 \nGutter Capacity Design \nSpouting should be installed with the back lower than the fascia board or cladding to allow for draining of\noverflow water through the gap between the gutter back and the fascia.\nA 2 mm gap between the back of the gutter and the fascia will give a discharge area equal to the diameter of a\n\n75 mm downpipe for every 2.2 m of gutter run.\nThis gap is only totally effective if the spouting is correctly maintained and the gap is free of debris. A designed\noutlet is preferred, either a gutter bracket creating a minimum 6 mm space stop end, a weir, a raised outlet above\nthe spouting sole, a slotted front, or a low fronted gutter.\nA weir stop-end, or an outlet with a top edge above the sole of the gutter, can be used to increase outlet capacity.\n5.4.2.1 \nGutter Fall \nAll gutters should have a minimum fall of 1:500 (2 mm in 1 m). A 1:200 (5 mm in 1 m) fall will give faster water\nflow and better self-cleaning, but it may look unattractive on external spouting due to misalignment with the\nfascia, and exposure of roof sheet ends, on longer lengths\n5.4.2.1A Effect of Gutter Fall on Drainage Capacity\n0 1 in \n100\n1 in \n200\n1 in \n300\n1 in \n400\n1 in \n500\n1in \n1000\nGutter Fall Ratio\nComparative roof area\n(m ) drained\n2\n5.4.2.2 \nMaximum Gutter Length \nAll gutters are subject to expansion. Maximum gutter-length is determined by the type of metal and its colour.\nWhere gutters have an allowance for expansion (such as an external gutter on a typical gutter bracket or an\ninternal gutter with sliding clips), lengths should be restricted to 25 m in steel and 12 m for copper or aluminium.\nAn expansion joint can be either a sump, rainwater head or a saddle flashing. Gutters that are directly through-\nfastened to the fascia or eaves purlin will not be free to move and should be restricted to a maximum of 12 m.\nThrough-fastened gutters are not recommended as they are difficult to replace.\n5.4.2.3 \nSpouting Support Systems \nThe spouting bracket system must withstand the potential weight of a gutter full of water. In snow load\nareas, spouting may be fitted with snow straps and brackets at a maximum of 600 mm centres to\nwithstand the additional potential weight of any snow build-up.\n\nBrackets should be made of compatible material or non-ferrous metal. Brackets for unpainted spouting should be\nhot dipped galvanised or have an AZ150 or Z450 or equivalent coating. Unpainted Z275 brackets are not\nacceptable nor are painted or unpainted electro-plated brackets. Brackets for pre-painted spouting must be\npainted or powder-coated before installation, where they must be colour-matched. In severe marine areas,\nbrackets should be epoxy primed before powder coating or should be formed from non-ferrous metal.\n5.4.2.3A Spouting Support System Durability\nBrackets for external gutters should be located close to all stop-ends, at both ends of sumps and rain-heads at a\nmaximum of 750 mm spacing for gutters less than 180 mm wide, and at 600 mm for gutters 180 - 300 mm wide.\nBrackets must be installed to provide a 1:500 (2 mm per metre) minimum gutter gradient towards the outlets.\n5.4.3 \nInternal Corners \nWhen the back of a gutter is cut down to allow the valley to discharge into it, the gutter capacity is affected. In\nthese cases, gutter calculations should allow for 20 mm less water height, and a min 3 mm spacer should be\nattached to the back of the gutter (or fascia) at the internal corner to maintain the clearance between the gutter\nand the fascia.\n5.4.4 \nConcealed Fascia Gutters \nConcealed gutter systems are bespoke or proprietary systems that run inside the fascia.\n\nThe concealed gutter design must ensure that water cannot enter the soffit or overflow into the building if the\ngutter system outlet becomes blocked.\nOverflows must be provided for concealed gutter systems within 1 m on either side of the downpipe to discharge\nthrough the soffit, immediately behind the fascia, and be capable of discharging the total catchment area served\nby the downpipe.\nSee 5.6.3 Overflows.\n5.4.5 \nInternal Gutters \nWhen internal gutters are difficult to replace and their failure could cause major disruption to the\nbuilding below, they must be made from materials that will last 50 years to comply with the NZBC;\nmetallic coated steel is not recommended for internal gutters that are difficult to replace.\nCommon internal gutter materials are butyl or other membranes, fibreglass, or non-ferrous metal. Where butyl\ngutters are used, the metal and flashings should be separated from wet contact with the butyl rubber.\n5.4.5A Separation of Butyl Gutter and Metal Roofing\nParapet Cap\nKick-out to avoid\ncontact\nLap-seal Tape\nButyl Gutter\nKick-out to\navoid wet area\nSuitable non-ferrous metals include 0.9 mm aluminium, 0.6 mm stainless steel, and 0.6 mm copper. Contact\nbetween coated metal products and copper or stainless steel must be avoided because it will lead to early\ncorrosion. Splashback or runoff from copper onto coated metal can have the same effect.\n5.4.5.1 \nInternal Gutter Design Features \nAll internal gutters must have upstands that are hooked or returned. Gutters that return under the\neaves are not recommended as this design makes removal for replacement more difficult.\n\n5.4.5.1A Hooks and Returns\nHook\nReturn\nTo prevent permanent deflection of the gutter, support for the sole of an internal gutter should be provided by\neither a plywood lining or by close ribbed sheets of roof cladding, separated by a layer of roofing underlay.\nInternal gutter support must be strong enough to support the weight of water when at capacity, and if over\n300 mm wide, be able to support foot traffic.\nInternal box gutters must have a minimum depth of 50 mm at their lowest point, including freeboard. A width to\nheight ratio of 2:1 plus freeboard gives maximum flow as it minimises wet surface area for a given cross-\nsectional area.\nA sharp direction change in flow of an internal gutter will affect discharge capacity. Where two buildings\nmeet at an angle, each gutter must be drained separately, or a specific discharge capacity calculation\nmust be applied.\nInternal gutters should have an expansion joint at the stop-end.\nOutflows from internal gutters may be scuppers or weirs.\n5.4.5.1B Scupper\n5.4.5.1C Weir\n\nA scupper is formed where an internal gutter discharges horizontally through the side or end wall of a gutter\n5.4.6 \nSecret Gutters \nA secret gutter is used where the roof edge runs at an angle of less than 90 deg to a wall, barge, or parapet.\n5.4.6A Secret Gutters Behind Barge\n5.4.6B Secret Gutter Detail\nPurlin\nUnderlay\nRafter\nTop\nplate\nBlocking \npiece\nFlying \nrafter\n50 \nmin\n50\nBarge capping\nc/w kick-out\nSecret gutters should be wide enough to allow for cleaning and must be designed in accordance with 5.4.5.1\nInternal Gutter Design Features. \n5.4.7 \nGutter Capacity Calculator \nA responsive online tool for calculating gutter capacity is available at\nwww.metalroofing.org.nz/cop/capacity-calculations.\nValleys \nA valley is a gutter at the internal intersection of two sloping panes of roof cladding.\n5.5.1 \nValley Fixing \nValleys may be securely fixed (through-fixed) at the upper end/head only. The remaining length of the gutter must\nbe retained using alternative methods that allow for thermal expansion and contraction without piercing the sole\nof the gutter.\nAlternative means of securing the valley gutter to the substrate with allowance for thermal movement include:\nA clip system.\nA compatible washered nail or screw or a galvanised nail, bent to form a cleat, provided they do not penetrate\nthe sole of the gutter.\n5.5.1A Correct Valley Fixing, Allowing for Thermal Movement\nRidge purlin\nClip\nWashered nail\nor screw.\nValley board\nValley purlin\nStop-end\n\n5.5.1B Valley Junction at the Apex, Method 1\nExtend ridge under roofing\n5.5.1C Valley Junction at the Apex, Method 2\nCut and fold ridge\nover roofing\n5.5.2 \nValley Design \n\nValley gutters must discharge into a rainwater head, sump, or an eaves gutter. The discharge point must\nbe within 2 m of a downpipe if the catchment area exceeds 50 m.\nWhen the roof pitch is less than 12 deg , the valley should be made in one piece or the joints must be sealed. To\nensure snug fitting, the valley angle should be matched to the pitch of the valley support. Having the valley too\nopen will result in a diminished capacity, and too sharp an angle will make installation difficult.\nRoof Pitch\n3 deg \n8 deg \n10 deg \n12.5 deg \n15\n20 deg \n25 deg \n30 deg \nA 3-fold\nB Standard\nC Deep\nD Tile\nFreeboard: 15 mm for pitches 8 deg and above\n 20 mm for pitches below 8 deg \nFor other pitches, rainfall intensity, and valley shapes refer to the 5.5.7 Valley Capacity Calculator tool.\nFor information about internal corners, refer to 5.4.3 Internal Corners.\n5.5.3 \nBifurcated Valleys \nThe maximum recommended catchment area for a bifurcated valley is 10 m. \n5.5.2A Common Valley Shapes\nB Standard\nC Deep\nD Tile\nA 3-Fold\n5.5.2B Internal Valley Angle\nRoof Pitch\nInternal Angle\n3 deg \n176 deg \n173 deg \n10 deg \n166 deg \n15 deg \n159 deg \n20 deg \n152 deg \n25 deg \n145 deg \n30 deg \n139 deg \n35 deg \n132 deg \n40 deg \n126 deg \n45 deg \n120 deg \n50 deg \n114 deg \n60 deg \n104 deg \n\n5.5.3A Ridge Meets a Valley in line with the Valley\n5.5.4 \nIntersecting Valleys \n5.5.5 \nChanging Angles in Valleys \nA change of roof pitch in a valley run will usually result in a change of angle in plan view.

As these\nhave reduced cross-section area compared to a symmetrical valley at the same (lower) pitch, it is often\nnecessary to increase the valley dimensions. Increasing the depth has the biggest effect on capacity. Greater\ndepth can be gained by using 10 mm ply valley boards, standing purlins on edge, or fitting valley boards flush with\nthe rafter. The consequences that a deeper valley will have on the capacity of the gutter it discharges into must\nalso be considered.\nA valley bae is required in all cases where a valley has a change of angle or when the dierence in roof pitch\nexceeds 10 deg . Valley baffles are also helpful in wooded locations to minimise lodging of debris under the roof\noverhang.\n\n5.5.6A Valley Baffle\n3-5 mm gap\nValley baffle\nHem\nEaves purlin\nHem\nValley Board\nValley\n5.5.7 \nValley Capacity Calculator \nThe values for 5.5.2C Maximum Valley Catchment in m for Areas Having a 50-year Rainfall\nIntensity <150 mm/h can be found in this PDF document. A responsive online tool for calculating valley\ncapacity is available at 5.5.7 Valley Capacity Calculator.\nOutlets \nA gutter's discharge capacity increases with the depth of water over the outlet. The best way to increase the head\nis to discharge the open end of the gutter into a rainwater head or sump. Swirl at the outlet reduces its\nperformance, so the positioning of the outlet is important.\nOutlets must be placed at a distance less than or equal to the outlet diameter from the nearest vertical\nside of the sump.\nRainwater heads are situated outside the building envelope, and sumps are internally located.\nThey both serve to increase the head of water entering a downpipe and to provide an overflow capacity to safely\ndischarge water when the downpipe capacity is compromised or exceeded. The overflow should be obvious so\ndischarging water warns the occupant that the downpipe capacity has been exceeded or the primary downpipe is\nblocked.\n5.6A Internal Gutter Discharging into a Rainwater Head\nLine of gutter sole\nDimension Y equal to\ndepth of gutter at outflow\nY\nY\nZ\nW\nDimension\nW equal to\nthe width of\nthe gutter\nor scupper,\nplus 3mm\nDimension Z\nequals a minimum\nof 25 mm\n\n5.6B External Gutter Discharging into a Rainwater Head\n5.6.1 \nRainwater Heads \nRainwater heads must be at least as wide as the gutter and have an overflow (normally a weir type). The\ncross-sectional area of the overflow must be at least equal to that of the required downpipe size for the\ncatchment being served. The lower edge of the overflow must be at least 25 mm below the sole of the\ngutter, and the upper edge must be at least 25 mm below the upper edge of the gutter.\n5.6.2 \nSumps \nSumps can be any width; many are pre-made in plastic, ready for insertion. Sumps must have an outlet positioned\nbelow the sole of the gutter to increase the water head at the outlet.\n\n5.6.2A Sump - Same Width as Gutter\nInternal sumps must have overflows. These are often a secondary pipe overflow, with the outlet height positioned\nabove the level of the primary outlet. Internal sumps must also be sealed against the sides and sole of the gutter.\n5.6.2B Sump with Overflow\nInternal sump\nwith overt\noverflow to\nground level\nAn internal sump should have a guard that prevents debris from blocking the outlet. A removable aluminium\nexpanded-metal box can be fitted at a minimum of 40 mm below the sole of the gutter. Because the top is flat, it\nis unlikely that the entire surface area of the outlet can become blocked, so it is preferable to balloon-type\nguards. A leaf guard should have a horizontal surface area of at least four times the size of the downpipe outlet\narea and should be installed at roughly mid-height of the sump depth. Gratings can cause sump blockage, and this\ncan reduce the outlet capacity.\n\n5.6.2C Sump with a Leaf Guard\nGratings or guards should be designed so that any debris will float, and hail, or obstructions, such as a tennis ball,\nwill not wedge and block the guard. Gratings or guards should be cleared of accumulated debris regularly as part\nof normal maintenance.\n5.6.3 \nOverflows \nOverflows must discharge clear of the building to clearly show that downpipe capacity has been\nexceeded; it should be an obvious indication that the gutters need maintenance.\nA scupper outlet to a rainwater head must have a cross-sectional area equal to 1 times that of the downpipe\noutlet. The bottom of the overflow must be no higher than 25 mm below the bottom of the spouting.\nWhere the position of an outlet of a parapet wall gutter is on an outside wall, any scupper outflow should\ndischarge into a rainwater head.\nDownpipes \nWhere they are connected directly to the drain, all internal downpipes must be sealed to internal sumps\nby a compression ring or similar fitting, and must have access for cleaning at the base. All sump\ndownpipes must be able to withstand a water pressure test with an applied head of 1.5 m of water\nwithout leakage.\nTo avoid any water back-up if the drain capacity is overloaded or obstructed, an air-break should be provided for\nall downpipes to ensure that water does not back up the downpipe.\nAll exterior downpipes must discharge freely over a grated gully trap or into an oversized pipe which\nmust be a minimum of 50 mm above the adjacent ground level.\nDownpipe retaining brackets, otherwise known as stand-off clips, are used to align the downpipe\nbetween the dropper and and discharge sump. Normally, they are situated near both ends of the\ndownpipe, with intermediate brackets placed in high traffic areas or where the span is greater than 3 m.\n5.7A Downpipe Draining into a Grated Gully Trap\n\n5.7B Downpipe Draining into an Oversized Pipe\n12 mm\ndownpipe\n12 mm\nDrain\n75 mm\nDownpipes must be compatible with the roof and gutter material. Discharging water off an inert surface\nonto unpainted galvanised surfaces can cause corrosion. See 4.11 Inert Catchment.\nHorizontally run PVC downpipes and gutters require a greater provision for expansion than metal, particularly if\nthey are painted a dark colour. Provision for expansion with PVC gutters and downpipes should be made\naccording to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nWhen rainwater is collected into a water tank, there is often not enough distance to obtain\nadequate fall for one downpipe outlet. In such cases, or whenever the roof design pre-empts a\ncontinuous spouting to the tank, it is possible to have several sealed downpipes (some of which can\nrun underground) to discharge into the tank. The outlet discharging into such pipes should be a\nrainwater head to avoid flooding.\n5.7C Collecting Rainwater in Tanks\n300 mm fall\nRainwater heads\nPlacement of Downpipes \nPlacement of downpipes significantly affects gutter and downpipe calculations.\n5.7.1A Downpipe Placement\n100%\n50%\n50%\n100%\n50%\n50%\n50%\n50%\n100%\n25% 25% 25% 25%\n50%\n50%\nGutter catchment 100% \nDownpipe catchment 100%\nGutter catchment 50% \nDownpipe Catchment 100%\nGutter catchment 50% \nDownpipe catchment 50%\nGutter catchment 25% \nDownpipe catchment 50%\n5.7.2 \nCapacity Table for Common Size Downpipes \nUse this table to select the correct internal dimensions of common downpipe sizes for use in the online\ncalculator at 5.4.7 Gutter Capacity Calculator.\n\n5.7.2A Downpipe Capacity Table\nMaterial\nSize\nNominal\nDiameter\n(mm)\nInternal\nDimension\n(mm)\nx-Section\nArea\n(mm)\nPVC\n65 x 50\n65 x 52\n3380\n100 x 50\n102 x 51\nSteel\n90x50\n 90 x 50\n4400\n5.7.3 \nDownpipe Capacity Calculator \nThe values for 5.7.2 Capacity Table for Common Size Downpipes can be found in this PDF document.

A spreader should be used over multiple troughs.\nFor corrugate, a spreader should not discharge into a lapped trough. When using the COP calculator, discharge\nmay be into a lapped trough of a trapezoidal or a trough profile.\nThe area of discharge holes from a spreader should equal the cross-sectional area of the downpipe.\nThe 5.8.1 Maximum Area Above Spreader Calculator enables users to determine the maximum upper roof\narea that a lower roof can discharge for a given combination of rainfall intensity, roofing profile, and lower roof\npitch.\n5.8A Downpipe Spreader design\nUse the online calculator\nto determine the maximum\narea above spreader, based\non discharge capacity of the\nlower roof.\nArea of the discharge holes\n= cross sectional area\nof the downpipe.\nLower roof drainage capacity determines maximum\narea above\nspreader.

The HIRDS tool shows figures for historical\nrainfall intensities and predicted rainfall based on the anticipated effects of climate change, expressed as\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCP) levels.\nThe increased rainfall intensity in a worst-case scenario is typically 11 - 13% higher than historical levels, mostly\noccurring under the least intense (RCP 2.6) value. To ensure design calculations account for expected climate\nchange, use the most appropriate RCP level.\n\n5.3.2.1A RCP Level Descriptions\nRating\nDescription\nRCP 2.6 A very stringent pathway that assumes CO2 levels peak at 2020 and go to zero by 2100.\nRCP4.5\nAn intermediate scenario where CO2 levels peak by 2040, then decline due to the\ndecreased availability of fossil fuels.\nRCP 6.0 A stabilisation scenario, where CO2 emissions peak around 2080, then decline with the\ndeployment of various technologies and strategies.\nRCP 8.5 Worst-Case scenario where CO2 emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century.\nThought by some to be based on an overestimation of projected coal outputs.\n5.3.2.2 \nDuration \nRainfall intensity figures quoted on the NIWA site are for maximum intensity over a ten-minute duration. Intensity\nmay vary within this period, and roof drains can overflow quickly when demand exceeds capacity. A 1-minute\nrainfall intensity can be as much as 4.2 times higher than the 10-minute intensity.\n5.3.2.1B Example of RCP Values for\nRandomly Selected Locations\nLocation\nHistoricRCP\n2.6\nRCP\n4.5\nRCP\n6.0\nRCP\n8.5\n%\nchange\nWhangarei\n137\n147 150 149 152 11\nAuckland\nCentral\n121\n131 133 132 135 12\nMt\nMaunganui\n149\n161 164 163 167 12\nWaikanae\n107\n116 118 117 120 12\nChristchurch55\nDunedin\nQueenstown 55\nHuntly\n126\n136 138 137 140 11\nNelson\n114\n124 126 125 128 12\nSilverdale\n124\n134 136 135 138 11\n Visit NIWA HIRDS-tool to get the corresponding values\nfor specific locations.\n5.3.2.1C Example of increasing ARI\nfigures Using RCP Values from Random\nLocations\nMt.

This minimum factor varies by gutter location as follows.\n\n5.3.2.3A Short-Term Intensity Multiplication Factors\nApplication\nGutter Multiplier\nDownpipe Multiplier\nWith Overflow\nNo Overflow\nValleys\n3.1\nn/a\nn/a\nPenetrations\n3.1\nn/a\nn/a\nInternal Gutters Residential\nInternal Gutters Commercial\nExternal Gutters-no Overflow\nExternal Gutters-with Overflow\n5.3.2.3B Short-term Intensity Factor Explanation\nThese are minimum factors; higher factors may be applied at the designer's discretion.\nValleys, Penetrations, and Internal Gutters Residential have a minimum factor of 3.1 because failure of these\ngutters is likely to cause damage to internal elements. Where a 2% probability of flooding is unacceptable, a\nhigher figure should be used.\nInternal Gutters Commercial have a minimum factor of 2.2 as failure of these gutters is less likely to cause\nsevere damage and water run time may be longer. Short runs and steep pitches will reduce run time. (At\n250 mm/hr intensity and 3 degrees pitch, rain will take 2 minutes to travel 15 metres). For short runs, steeper\npitches and where the probability of flooding of 2% is unacceptable, a higher figure should be used.\nExternal Gutters no overflow have a minimum factor of 2.5, providing the building has a soffit. Otherwise, they\nshould be treated as an internal gutter.\nExternal Gutters with overflow have a minimum factor of 1, provided the building has a soffit, as occasional\noverflow is not likely to cause damage. To qualify as drained, the back of the gutter must be below the fascia\nheight and it must have a gap of at least 3 mm between the gutter and the fascia or cladding. This gap must be\nmaintained in all areas, including internal angles. External gutters to buildings without soffit must be provided\nwith a 10 mm drainage gap or be designed as an internal gutter.\nFor convenience, ARI maps are included in the calculation section which includes tables for gutter and valley\ncapacity for different rainfall intensities.\n5.3.3 \nMinimum Freeboard Values \nIn gutters where overflow can enter the structure, freeboard is necessary to allow for wave action, obstructions,\nand other unforeseen circumstances. Capacity Calculations allow for these minimum freeboard values.\n\n5.3.3A Minimum Freeboard Values\nGutter Type\nFreeboard\nInternal gutters\n30 mm\nSecret gutters\n15 mm\nValleys > 8 deg \n15 mm\nValleys < 8 deg \n20 mm\nAsymmetrical valleys\n20 mm\nExternal gutters with overflow\nNo freeboard required\nExternal gutters with no overflow\n15 mm",

In practice, this is rarely commercially\nacceptable. With sound design and reasonable maintenance, a spouting life of 10 years or more is usually\nachieved when using the same material as the profiled metal roof.\nSpouting that is difficult to access for replacement should be specified in more durable, compatible materials.\n5.4.1.1 \nBay Windows \nE1/AS1 does not prescribe a need for a building to have spouting, it merely requires that concentrations of water\ngathered by structures does not enter the building or cause damage or nuisance to other property. This is\ntraditionally achieved by using gutters and downpipes to discharge roof catchments into stormwater drains.\nMinor wall projections such as bay windows and boxed penetrations are treated as part of the wall catchment and\nare typically excused from requiring spouting and downpipe, provided the plan view surface area of individual\nprojections does not exceed 5 m2.\n5.4.1.2 \nOutbuildings \nSmall outbuildings such as garden sheds up to 10 are also traditionally exempted from requiring spouting and\ndownpipes providing the discharge does not interfere with neighbouring buildings.\n5.4.2 \nGutter Capacity Design \nSpouting should be installed with the back lower than the fascia board or cladding to allow for draining of\noverflow water through the gap between the gutter back and the fascia.\nA 2 mm gap between the back of the gutter and the fascia will give a discharge area equal to the diameter of a\n\n75 mm downpipe for every 2.2 m of gutter run.\nThis gap is only totally effective if the spouting is correctly maintained and the gap is free of debris. A designed\noutlet is preferred, either a gutter bracket creating a minimum 6 mm space stop end, a weir, a raised outlet above\nthe spouting sole, a slotted front, or a low fronted gutter.\nA weir stop-end, or an outlet with a top edge above the sole of the gutter, can be used to increase outlet capacity.\n5.4.2.1 \nGutter Fall \nAll gutters should have a minimum fall of 1:500 (2 mm in 1 m). A 1:200 (5 mm in 1 m) fall will give faster water\nflow and better self-cleaning, but it may look unattractive on external spouting due to misalignment with the\nfascia, and exposure of roof sheet ends, on longer lengths\n5.4.2.1A Effect of Gutter Fall on Drainage Capacity\n0 1 in \n100\n1 in \n200\n1 in \n300\n1 in \n400\n1 in \n500\n1in \n1000\nGutter Fall Ratio\nComparative roof area\n(m ) drained\n2\n5.4.2.2 \nMaximum Gutter Length \nAll gutters are subject to expansion. Maximum gutter-length is determined by the type of metal and its colour.\nWhere gutters have an allowance for expansion (such as an external gutter on a typical gutter bracket or an\ninternal gutter with sliding clips), lengths should be restricted to 25 m in steel and 12 m for copper or aluminium.\nAn expansion joint can be either a sump, rainwater head or a saddle flashing. Gutters that are directly through-\nfastened to the fascia or eaves purlin will not be free to move and should be restricted to a maximum of 12 m.\nThrough-fastened gutters are not recommended as they are difficult to replace.\n5.4.2.3 \nSpouting Support Systems \nThe spouting bracket system must withstand the potential weight of a gutter full of water. In snow load\nareas, spouting may be fitted with snow straps and brackets at a maximum of 600 mm centres to\nwithstand the additional potential weight of any snow build-up.\n\nBrackets should be made of compatible material or non-ferrous metal. Brackets for unpainted spouting should be\nhot dipped galvanised or have an AZ150 or Z450 or equivalent coating. Unpainted Z275 brackets are not\nacceptable nor are painted or unpainted electro-plated brackets. Brackets for pre-painted spouting must be\npainted or powder-coated before installation, where they must be colour-matched. In severe marine areas,\nbrackets should be epoxy primed before powder coating or should be formed from non-ferrous metal.\n5.4.2.3A Spouting Support System Durability\nBrackets for external gutters should be located close to all stop-ends, at both ends of sumps and rain-heads at a\nmaximum of 750 mm spacing for gutters less than 180 mm wide, and at 600 mm for gutters 180 - 300 mm wide.\nBrackets must be installed to provide a 1:500 (2 mm per metre) minimum gutter gradient towards the outlets.\n5.4.3 \nInternal Corners \nWhen the back of a gutter is cut down to allow the valley to discharge into it, the gutter capacity is affected. In\nthese cases, gutter calculations should allow for 20 mm less water height, and a min 3 mm spacer should be\nattached to the back of the gutter (or fascia) at the internal corner to maintain the clearance between the gutter\nand the fascia.\n5.4.4 \nConcealed Fascia Gutters \nConcealed gutter systems are bespoke or proprietary systems that run inside the fascia.\n\nThe concealed gutter design must ensure that water cannot enter the soffit or overflow into the building if the\ngutter system outlet becomes blocked.\nOverflows must be provided for concealed gutter systems within 1 m on either side of the downpipe to discharge\nthrough the soffit, immediately behind the fascia, and be capable of discharging the total catchment area served\nby the downpipe.\nSee 5.6.3 Overflows.\n5.4.5 \nInternal Gutters \nWhen internal gutters are difficult to replace and their failure could cause major disruption to the\nbuilding below, they must be made from materials that will last 50 years to comply with the NZBC;\nmetallic coated steel is not recommended for internal gutters that are difficult to replace.\nCommon internal gutter materials are butyl or other membranes, fibreglass, or non-ferrous metal. Where butyl\ngutters are used, the metal and flashings should be separated from wet contact with the butyl rubber.\n5.4.5A Separation of Butyl Gutter and Metal Roofing\nParapet Cap\nKick-out to avoid\ncontact\nLap-seal Tape\nButyl Gutter\nKick-out to\navoid wet area\nSuitable non-ferrous metals include 0.9 mm aluminium, 0.6 mm stainless steel, and 0.6 mm copper. Contact\nbetween coated metal products and copper or stainless steel must be avoided because it will lead to early\ncorrosion. Splashback or runoff from copper onto coated metal can have the same effect.\n5.4.5.1 \nInternal Gutter Design Features \nAll internal gutters must have upstands that are hooked or returned. Gutters that return under the\neaves are not recommended as this design makes removal for replacement more difficult.\n\n5.4.5.1A Hooks and Returns\nHook\nReturn\nTo prevent permanent deflection of the gutter, support for the sole of an internal gutter should be provided by\neither a plywood lining or by close ribbed sheets of roof cladding, separated by a layer of roofing underlay.\nInternal gutter support must be strong enough to support the weight of water when at capacity, and if over\n300 mm wide, be able to support foot traffic.\nInternal box gutters must have a minimum depth of 50 mm at their lowest point, including freeboard. A width to\nheight ratio of 2:1 plus freeboard gives maximum flow as it minimises wet surface area for a given cross-\nsectional area.\nA sharp direction change in flow of an internal gutter will affect discharge capacity. Where two buildings\nmeet at an angle, each gutter must be drained separately, or a specific discharge capacity calculation\nmust be applied.\nInternal gutters should have an expansion joint at the stop-end.\nOutflows from internal gutters may be scuppers or weirs.\n5.4.5.1B Scupper\n5.4.5.1C Weir\n\nA scupper is formed where an internal gutter discharges horizontally through the side or end wall of a gutter\n5.4.6 \nSecret Gutters \nA secret gutter is used where the roof edge runs at an angle of less than 90 deg to a wall, barge, or parapet.\n5.4.6A Secret Gutters Behind Barge\n5.4.6B Secret Gutter Detail\nPurlin\nUnderlay\nRafter\nTop\nplate\nBlocking \npiece\nFlying \nrafter\n50 \nmin\n50\nBarge capping\nc/w kick-out\nSecret gutters should be wide enough to allow for cleaning and must be designed in accordance with 5.4.5.1\nInternal Gutter Design Features. \n5.4.7 \nGutter Capacity Calculator \nA responsive online tool for calculating gutter capacity is available at\nwww.metalroofing.org.nz/cop/capacity-calculations.",

The remaining length of the gutter must\nbe retained using alternative methods that allow for thermal expansion and contraction without piercing the sole\nof the gutter.\nAlternative means of securing the valley gutter to the substrate with allowance for thermal movement include:\nA clip system.\nA compatible washered nail or screw or a galvanised nail, bent to form a cleat, provided they do not penetrate\nthe sole of the gutter.\n5.5.1A Correct Valley Fixing, Allowing for Thermal Movement\nRidge purlin\nClip\nWashered nail\nor screw.\nValley board\nValley purlin\nStop-end\n\n5.5.1B Valley Junction at the Apex, Method 1\nExtend ridge under roofing\n5.5.1C Valley Junction at the Apex, Method 2\nCut and fold ridge\nover roofing\n5.5.2 \nValley Design \n\nValley gutters must discharge into a rainwater head, sump, or an eaves gutter. The discharge point must\nbe within 2 m of a downpipe if the catchment area exceeds 50 m.\nWhen the roof pitch is less than 12 deg , the valley should be made in one piece or the joints must be sealed. To\nensure snug fitting, the valley angle should be matched to the pitch of the valley support.

As these\nhave reduced cross-section area compared to a symmetrical valley at the same (lower) pitch, it is often\nnecessary to increase the valley dimensions. Increasing the depth has the biggest effect on capacity. Greater\ndepth can be gained by using 10 mm ply valley boards, standing purlins on edge, or fitting valley boards flush with\nthe rafter. The consequences that a deeper valley will have on the capacity of the gutter it discharges into must\nalso be considered.\nA valley bae is required in all cases where a valley has a change of angle or when the dierence in roof pitch\nexceeds 10 deg .

The\ncross-sectional area of the overflow must be at least equal to that of the required downpipe size for the\ncatchment being served. The lower edge of the overflow must be at least 25 mm below the sole of the\ngutter, and the upper edge must be at least 25 mm below the upper edge of the gutter.\n5.6.2 \nSumps \nSumps can be any width; many are pre-made in plastic, ready for insertion. Sumps must have an outlet positioned\nbelow the sole of the gutter to increase the water head at the outlet.\n\n5.6.2A Sump - Same Width as Gutter\nInternal sumps must have overflows. These are often a secondary pipe overflow, with the outlet height positioned\nabove the level of the primary outlet. Internal sumps must also be sealed against the sides and sole of the gutter.\n5.6.2B Sump with Overflow\nInternal sump\nwith overt\noverflow to\nground level\nAn internal sump should have a guard that prevents debris from blocking the outlet. A removable aluminium\nexpanded-metal box can be fitted at a minimum of 40 mm below the sole of the gutter. Because the top is flat, it\nis unlikely that the entire surface area of the outlet can become blocked, so it is preferable to balloon-type\nguards. A leaf guard should have a horizontal surface area of at least four times the size of the downpipe outlet\narea and should be installed at roughly mid-height of the sump depth. Gratings can cause sump blockage, and this\ncan reduce the outlet capacity.\n\n5.6.2C Sump with a Leaf Guard\nGratings or guards should be designed so that any debris will float, and hail, or obstructions, such as a tennis ball,\nwill not wedge and block the guard. Gratings or guards should be cleared of accumulated debris regularly as part\nof normal maintenance.\n5.6.3 \nOverflows \nOverflows must discharge clear of the building to clearly show that downpipe capacity has been\nexceeded; it should be an obvious indication that the gutters need maintenance.\nA scupper outlet to a rainwater head must have a cross-sectional area equal to 1 times that of the downpipe\noutlet. The bottom of the overflow must be no higher than 25 mm below the bottom of the spouting.\nWhere the position of an outlet of a parapet wall gutter is on an outside wall, any scupper outflow should\ndischarge into a rainwater head.",

When using the COP calculator, discharge\nmay be into a lapped trough of a trapezoidal or a trough profile.\nThe area of discharge holes from a spreader should equal the cross-sectional area of the downpipe.\nThe 5.8.1 Maximum Area Above Spreader Calculator enables users to determine the maximum upper roof\narea that a lower roof can discharge for a given combination of rainfall intensity, roofing profile, and lower roof\npitch.\n5.8A Downpipe Spreader design\nUse the online calculator\nto determine the maximum\narea above spreader, based\non discharge capacity of the\nlower roof.\nArea of the discharge holes\n= cross sectional area\nof the downpipe.\nLower roof drainage capacity determines maximum\narea above\nspreader. It is dependent on:\n rainfall intensity,\n lower roof profile,\n lower roof pitch,\n lower roof length,\ndownpipe/spreader capacity\nDischarge holes every\nsecond corrugation.\n5.8.1 \nMaximum Area Above Spreader Calculator \nBefore using this calculator, please read 5.3 Roof Drainage Design.\nCalculate the maximum area above a spreader by entering the values in the designated fields.\nFor an explanation of each element, please click on the corresponding question mark.\n\nFor rainfall intensities, refer to NIWA's HIRDS tool or the 5.3.2 Rainfall Intensity.\nA responsive online tool for calculating Maximum Area Above Spreaders is available at\nhttps://www.metalroofing.org.nz/maximum-area-above-spreader-calculator.",
