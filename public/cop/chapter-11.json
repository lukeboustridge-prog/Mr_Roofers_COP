Sheets can have a film or a coating on one or both sides or have a film on one side\nand a coating on the other. The performance of GRP is related to both light transmission and\ndurability of the various films, and coatings can provide different performance for each category in\ndifferent environments.\nN.B. Performance in both of these areas is not necessarily directly related.\nThe roofing contractor must ensure that the correct weathering surface of plastic sheeting is placed\nuppermost as the durability and warranty depend on placing the sheet the correct side up.\n11.2.2 \nPolycarbonate \nPolycarbonate is a tough, clear thermoplastic polymer with a higher deformation temperature than\nPVC.\nPolycarbonate is manufactured with a co-extruded UV resistant top layer, which will resist\nweathering, but its durability depends on the thickness of the top layer.\nProfiled polycarbonate sheeting has a limited spanning capacity and requires greater provision for\nexpansion than GRP. It is available in thicknesses from 0.8 mm to 1.5 mm but is only available in a\nlimited range of profiles.\nFlat multi-wall extruded sheets with one or more air gaps have a thinner wall thickness but derive\ntheir rigidity from the shape of the profile. They are limited in spanning capability, but come in\nwide sheets, fixed into proprietary extrusions, and are suitable as continuous barrel vaults and as\ndouble skin roof lights.\nSurface coatings provide different levels of durability, chemical resistance and weather resistance.\nPolycarbonate sheets must not be fitted above sprinklers as they can drop out in a fire and interfere\nwith the sprinkler's function.\n11.2.3 \nPVC \nPVC is a compound of polyvinyl chloride manufactured with stabilisers but without plasticisers that complies\nwith AS/NZS 4256.2. Profiled PVC roof lights have a limited spanning capacity and need greater provision for\nexpansion than other plastics or metals.\n 11 \n 11.2 NATURAL LIGHT MATERIALS\n 2 \n 11 \n 11.2 \n340\nThis is a controlled document.

PVC softens at 80 deg C and will act as a smoke vent when heated during a fire. It has a service temperature\nof 60 deg C and a tensile strength of 52 MPa at 20 deg C.\nPVC may not satisfy the 15-year durability requirements of the NZBC; it is not regarded as suitable\nfor commercial or industrial use and should not be used in habitable buildings.\nPVC sheets must not be fitted above sprinklers, as they can drop out during a fire and interfere with the\nsprinkler's function.\n 11 \n 11.2 NATURAL LIGHT MATERIALS\n 2 \n 11 \n 11.2 \n341\nThis is a controlled document.

The test provisions of AS/NZS 4257 require the measure\nto be calculated from the area of the profile, including the overlap. Because the mass of plastic sheeting varies\nbetween profiles, the thickness will vary for different profiles of a given weight per square metre. Deeper profiled\nproducts are usually supplied as standard at a greater weight per square metre than more material-efficient\nprofiles.\n11.3.1 \nPoint Load on Translucent Sheets \nStandard profiled roof lights are classified as brittle roofing and are not suitable for roof traffic. They are normally\nlaid over safety mesh to AS 4859. (See 13.4.4 Safety Netting)\nTrafficable roof lights are normally rendered trafficable by embedding a woven glass mat into the material. They\nmust be tested under the point load test provisions of AS 4040.1, AS/NZS 4040.4, and AS/NZS 1562.3: 2006. \nNon-trafficable sheets over one sheet in width should be provided with a walkway, terminate short of ridge and/or\neaves, to enable transverse traffic.\n11.3.2 \nDistributed Loads on Translucent Sheeting \nThe spanning capacity of profiled roof lights depends on the profile shape, material thickness and composition,\nthe number of fasteners per square metre, and the washer type and size. \nPull-though of the fastener is the most common failure mode of profiled translucent sheeting, so it should always\nbe installed with a load spreading washer unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.\nAdditional support can be obtained from adjacent metal cladding by using mid-span supports, alternatively, the\nthickness of the roof lights may be increased.\nProfiled translucent sheeting must be designed to be capable of withstanding design wind loads, using the\nmanufacturer's literature.\n 11 \n 11.3 PERFORMANCE - STRUCTURE\n 3 \n 11 \n 11.3 \n342\nThis is a controlled document.

Tinting can be coloured or translucent.\nTo decrease heat loss and prevent condensation, multi-skinned systems can be employed to provide insulation.\nIn colder areas, UV-stabilised EVA copolymer film is often used under profiled skylights to minimise\ncondensation. Where buildings are heated, or where condensation cannot be tolerated, multi skinned systems are\nrecommended.\n11.4A Double-Skinned Rooflight.\nMetal roof Rooflight\nLoad \nspreading \nwasher\nPurlin\nFlat multi-wall \nPolycarbonate \nsheet\nPacker, parallel to \nthe purlin\nMetal roof\nUnderlay\nSafety \nmesh\n11.4B Rooflight without Spacers\nFasteners at\neach rib\n36 mm EPDM\nsealing washer\nLoad spreading \nwasher\nPurlin\n 11 \n 11.4 THERMAL RESISTANCE\n 11 \n 11.4 \n344\nThis is a controlled document.

Regular roof light areas range from 5% of the\nfloor area for warehouses to 10 - 15% for industrial buildings, and 20% for sports halls and factories where\nintricate work is done.\nProprietary skylights are usually strategically positioned to bring borrowed light into specific areas that are not\notherwise naturally lit. Often these are also designed to provide ventilation.\n 11 \n 11.5 LIGHT TRANSMISSION\n 5 \n 11 \n 11.5 \n346\nThis is a controlled document.

Some fasteners drill their own clearance holes, otherwise pre-\ndrilling is required. Although GRP has approximately twice the expansion as steel, it absorbs less energy from the\nsun, so the same expansion allowances as used for the adjacent steel sheet can be applied.\nRoof netting and safety mesh can damage GRP through expansion movement and walking traffic. GRP can be\nprotected at the purlin by placing a small slip sheet of GRP between the netting and the roof light.\n11.6A Translucent Sheet End Lap\nLongrun\nMetalroofing\nLap seal tape 16 mm x 3 mm thick\nor 2 beads of neutral curing\nsilicone sealant to achieve a full\nseal across the profile.\nSafety mesh\nSteel Purlin\nFibreglass purlin \nprotectionstrip fixed to \ntop of purlinOver Safety \nmesh.\nTranslucent sheet\n250 mm Cover\n150 mm\nmax\nPolycarbonate sheets expand more than steel, and so are only available in lengths up to 7.2 m. When directly\ninstalling polycarbonate sheets, friction tape can be placed on the purlins to reduce thermally induced noise.\nManufacturers recommend side lap fasteners on translucent sheets to maintain the integrity of the side laps.\nTurn up stop ends are not easily formed with profiled skylights. To prevent blow over at the upper end of sheets,\nan angle or odd leg J-shaped channel is normally attached to the upper end of sheets with rivets and sealed with\nsilicon or MS sealant.\n 11 \n 11.6 INSTALLING TRANSLUCENT SHEETS\n 6 \n 11 \n 11.6 \n347\nThis is a controlled document.

Both are available either clear or tinted and may be integrated with a\npermanent, manually operated, or automated ventilation function.\nRectangular skylights typically consist of a timber or aluminium base which must be flashed into the roof\ncladding, using one of the methods detailed in 9 External Moisture Penetrations. The designer should\nselect which flashing detail is optimal for the application and detail it accordingly. To enable efficient design and\nprevent excessive use of over flashings, designers should also consider the placement of skylights in relation to\neach other and other architectural elements,\nRetrofitted skylights, not included in the original design, often result in unsightly, leaky, and excessive over-\nflashings. Such additions often evade compliance inspections. If skylights are likely to be required, it is strongly\nrecommended that thought be given to their location and design so that they can be appropriately detailed on the\nconsent drawings.\nDome flashings often come with a flashing kit, making them simpler to install, and many have flexible light tubes\nleading to a ceiling light diffuser, avoiding the need to frame out and line the roof space between the skylight and\nthe ceiling. This allows the upper section to be positioned in an optimal position to facilitate flashing design.\n11.7A Skytube\n11.7B Skylight\n 11 \n 11.7 STAND-ALONE ROOFLIGHTS\n 7 \n 11 \n 11.7 \n349\nThis is a controlled document.

Some fasteners drill their own clearance holes, otherwise pre-\ndrilling is required. Although GRP has approximately twice the expansion as steel, it absorbs less energy from the\nsun, so the same expansion allowances as used for the adjacent steel sheet can be applied.\nRoof netting and safety mesh can damage GRP through expansion movement and walking traffic.
