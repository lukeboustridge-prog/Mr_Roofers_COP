Draped sheets, known as spring curving.\n2. Pre-curved sheets, either roll-curved or crimp-curved.\nThe system used depends on the design of the structure and the selected profile. Spring curving can be used on\nwider radii, while pre-curving can generally be done down to a 300mm or 400mm radius.\nCurved flashings are described in 8.5.5 Curved Flashings\n15.1.1 \nSide Laps: Curved Roofs \nThe minimum pitch for curved roofs may differ from that otherwise recommended for the profile.\nFor barrel curved roofs, the lap sealed section over the apex is exempt from minimum pitch requirements,\nprovided that the required minimum pitch is achieved at the eaves. For mono-pitch curved roofs terminating at a\ntransverse apron or head barge, the minimum pitch at the apex is 5 deg for corrugate or 3 deg for other profiles. Where\nthis is less than the normal recommended for the profile, flashing cover must be increased to the next higher\ncategory in accordance with guidelines in 8.4 Flashing Cover.\nThis limitation does not apply to roofs outside of the building envelope, such as curved verandah roofs, provided\nany spill-over is unable to penetrate the structure.\nSelect your profile, then enter either the height or desired radius in the calculator below to determine the length of\nthe seal.\nThe Code of Practice Online provides an interactive tool for these calculations.

Transverse laps should be\nsealed at both edges to prevent the ingress of both rainwater and condensation, in accordance with 14.11.1\nSealing End Laps.\n15.1.3 \nPenetrations: Curved Roofs \nPenetrations should be placed at the apex, or where the pitch is greater than the minimum for the profile.\n15.1.4 \nVentilation: Curved Roofs \nBarrel curved roofs have no ridging to allow water vapour to exit at the ridge, so other means of venting the\nceiling space should be considered. (See 10.10 Ventilation Pathways.)\n15.1.5 \nThermal Expansion: Curved Roofs \nProvision for expansion should be provided in the same manner as required for straight lengths, but the\nconfiguration of curved roofs means that some expansion will be taken up by a springing of the profile further up,\nwhich results in less movement. When the total sheet length is considered for expansion, positive fixing should\nbe used at the crown, and provision for expansion accommodated on the slopes. Sealed and fastened end laps\ndo not act as an expansion joint.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n413\nThis is a controlled document.

Therefore, it needs to be washed and regularly maintained to comply with the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC and the supplier's warranty. Because pre-painted cladding is not intended for use in this\ntype of micro-climate without regular maintenance, the underside of the soffit should be lined in all severe and\nvery severe environments. (see 16 Maintenance )\n15.1.7 \nSpring Curving \nSpring curving, also known as draping or arching of roofs, is a method of providing continuous lengths of roof\ncladding over a curved roof structure without pre-curving the sheets. It is best suited to corrugated profiles, or\nsymmetrical roofing profiles of low rib height and narrow pan width, which can follow a curve without excessive\npanning or distortion. Asymmetrical rib products have greater minimum radii, which are limited by their pan width\nand rib height.\nBecause symmetrical profiles do not have a large rain-water carrying capacity they are limited in maximum radius\nand length. Maximum radius is limited by the need to provide adequate drainage at the top of the curvature and\nminimum radius is limited by the need to avoid distortion without pre-forming.\nContinuity over a minimum of three purlins is required for successful spring curving and therefore any interruption\nsuch as a penetration may affect the ability of the sheet to drape curve.\nPurlins must be accurately positioned with the top faces tangential to the radius of the arch and should be within\na 5 mm tolerance to avoid purlin creasing. Roof traffic should be restricted to avoid damage, particularly in the\nlow pitched region or in highly visible areas, particularly in the low-pitched region or in highly visible areas. Some\npurlin creasing or canning is to be expected with stronger profiles at minimum radii.\nFor convex roofs, the minimum radii should be adhered to because the pans are in compression, whereas with\nconcave roofs the pans are in tension and the panning or distortion of these roofs will be less.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n414\nThis is a controlled document.

When the base chord is on an incline, the maximum radius can be increased.\nThe two top purlins should be spaced to enable the sheeting to follow an arc that minimises purlin marking.\n15.1.7D Top Purlin Positioning for Spring Curved Roofs\nDraped curved roofs or curved ridges should be fixed by fastening each sheet first to one side of the roof and then\npulling it down to be fixed on the other side. Where sheets are end-lapped, alternate sheets should be laid in\nsequence to avoid cumulative errors and be laid from opposite sides of the roof to ensure squareness is\nmaintained.\nBecause extra uplift load will be imposed on the end fasteners of convex spring curved roofs, through the\ntorsional action of the sheets on the fasteners, screws and load spreading washers should be used on the\npenultimate and the last purlins. This torsional uplift must also be considered when designing purlin to rafter\nconnections and other structures below. \n15.1.8 \nPre-Curved Roofs \nLow tensile metals and G 300 coated steel can be formed into a number of simple and compound shapes. \nGenerally, roll curving is applied to corrugated profiles, and crimp curving to trapezoidal profiles.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n416\nThis is a controlled document.

Setting\nout requires first checking that the materials delivered on site are within specified tolerances, and before\ncommencing work the building should be checked for squareness.\nBoth roll curving and crimp curving will produce a curve with the effective cover dictated by the forming process. \nIt is critical that the material is run to the correct width before being presented to the curving tool, or the effective\ncover of the straight portion will not match that of the curve. A variation of only 2mm between the straight and\ncurved portion of a sheet will make it very difficult, or impossible, to install.\nThe curving process can cause dimensional changes, which can lead to misalignment, so the sheets should be\nkept square with the building. Some minor saw-toothing at the gutter end is to be expected when fitting curved\nsheeting. When multiple curves are required that cannot be provided on one sheet, the sheets should be fixed in\nthe order shown below.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n419\nThis is a controlled document.

Pre-curved corrugated roof cladding is used for bull-nosed\nveranda roofs, ridges, or roofs where the radius is less than the minimum required for sprung or draped curved\nroofs.\nThe sheets are passed through offset curving rolls, which progressively form curves in a wide range of radii down\nto 300 mm. There is, however, a straight portion of about 80 mm at each end of the sheet which may need to be\ntrimmed off if a true curve is required.\nCircular barns have been successfully clad with 0.4 mm steel for many years, but 0.55 mm steel or 0.9 mm\naluminium should be used for roll-curved roofs subject to foot traffic. As roll curving is normally done with G300\nsteel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials must be taken into account when setting\npurlin spacings.\nIf the edge of the sheet is too flat or long, and at tight radii, rippled edges may result, and these should be dressed\nout using a dressing tool, or trimmed off before the sheet is installed.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n420\nThis is a controlled document.

The radius can be altered by the\nspacing of the crimps and the angle of the bend by the number of crimps.\nAs crimp Curving is normally done with G300 steel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials\nmust be taken into account when setting purlin spacings.\n 15 \n 15.1 CURVED ROOFS\n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n421\nThis is a controlled document.

Structure - the effect of mounting the structures and roof traffic for ongoing maintenance; see 3.7.5 Dead\nLoads and 3.7.4 Roof Traffic.\n2. Durability - corrosion may result from issues such as wet contact, capillary action, unwashed areas, material\ncompatibility, and runoff; see 4.10 Other Causes of Corrosion.\n3. External Moisture - penetrations influence roof drainage and can affect weatherproofing of the cladding; see \n9.3 Penetration Durability and Compatibility.\n 15 \n 15.2 MOUNTING AIR CONDITIONING, AERIALS, AND SOLAR UNITS\n 2 \n 15 \n 15.2 \n422\nThis is a controlled document.

This may be an organic paint coating applied by either the steel manufacturer before the tiles are\nformed, or by the tile manufacturer after the tiles are formed. An alternative (and traditional) coating can be\nprovided by applying crushed stone or ceramic granules (\"chip\") to the base metallic-coated steel, which is\nattached by an adhesive coating; normally, a clear acrylic coat over the chip coating. Post-applied coating also\nprovides cut-edge protection.\nPressed metal roofing tiles are installed by nominated agent fixers, trained and appointed by the manufacturers or\ntheir representatives. They are not normally supplied to other installers.\n15.3.1.1 \nDurability \nThe principles behind requirements for fixings, flashings, corrosion, compatibility, and maintenance as described\nelsewhere in this COP should also apply to the design and installation of pressed metal tiles.\nFasteners must be compatible with the base metal and provide a service life equivalent to the durability of the\npanel. Typically, these are coated hot-dipped galvanised steel nails.\n15.3.1.2 \nStructure \nMetal tiles must be installed to battens selected, spaced, and attached as per the manufacturer's requirements.\nPanels are fastened to the roof structure by fixing horizontally through the front of the panel, and because the\nfixings are in shear, they provide wind uplift resistance suitable for very high wind design loads.\n15.3.1.3 \nMinimum Pitch \nTiles with a minimum upstand of 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 12 deg or more. Tiles with an\nupstand of less than 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 15 deg or more. Typically, these are tiles\nwith a shingle or shake form.\nThe manufacturer may stipulate greater or lesser minimum pitches for specific designs.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n423\nThis is a controlled document.

The pitch of the roof is not the same as the pitch of the tiles. It varies with the height of the batten\nand the height of the upstand.\n15.3.1.4 \nValleys \nValley gutters must be made of the same metal or coating as the roof tiles or a compatible material.\nValleys must have a minimum upstand of 20 mm and a width of 80 mm. For valley sizing, see 5.5.7\nValley Capacity Calculator.\nValley boards are required to support a point load of 1.1 kN, which approximates the weight of a\ntradesperson with a bag of tools.\n15.3.1.5 \nLongrun Tiles \nLongrun tiles are a hybrid roof cladding with the appearance of pressed metal tile. This is achieved by pressing\nsteps into a length of long run profiled steel, so horizontal laps are minimised or eliminated.\nLongrun tiles are not currently manufactured in New Zealand.\n15.3.2 \nInstallation \nPressed metal roofing tiles are only installed by specifically trained and accredited installers. As the battens go\nover the roofing overlay, the installer is responsible for doing the battens, as well as the underlay and the roof\ncladding.\n15.3.2.1 \nRoof Framing \nRoof framing should provide support and fixing for the tile battens that will satisfy the design wind load\nrequirements. Installers should check that the framing has been erected to an accurate and even line before fixing\nthe roof\n15.3.2.2 \nValley Installation \nValleys are installed so water discharges over the fascia and into the eaves gutter. The valleys are held in\nposition by clips specially designed to allow for expansion, or by compatible nails and washers placed alongside\nthe valley or bent over the top lip of the valley.\nUnder no circumstances must the fasteners penetrate the sole of the valley. The top end of the valley should be\nturned up against the hip or ridge battens to the height of the batten. Where two valleys meet over a dormer, they\nare cut, shaped, joined, and sealed so that they form a continuous valley.\nThe tile edge should be bent down to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\nThe gap between tiles on opposing sides of the valley must be a minimum of 70 mm.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n424\nThis is a controlled document.

The exception is at the eaves, where it is laid over the eaves batten\nand the fascia. Horizontal underlay laps should have a minimum overlap of 75 mm.\n15.3.2.3A Metal Tile Underlay\nGalvanised nail \nwith neoprene \nwasher\nUnderlay\n15.3.2.4 \nTiling Battens \nTiling battens must be:\nH1.1 boric-treated when used in attic roof construction;\nH1.2 treated when used in skillion roof construction.\nBatten sizes are:\na minimum of 50 mm x 40 mm for 900 mm rafter spacing; and\na minimum of 50 mm x 50 mm for 1200 mm spacing.\nBattens in contact with tiles must not be treated with copper-based preservatives. Battens required for rafter\nspacings greater than 1200 mm must be specifically designed and spaced to suit the tile module.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n425\nThis is a controlled document.

Battens at different centres may require different values.\n Battens must have square cut ends and must be butt jointed over the centre line of the rafter.\nAdjacent rows of battens must not be joined on the same rafter and must span at least three rafter spacings at\nthe roof edge.\nA batten must be installed immediately behind the fascia as fixing for the eaves tiles.\nBecause an eaves-tile batten is installed directly behind the fascia, the position of the next batten up the rafter will\nbe less than that of the normal tile batten spacing. The position of this batten may vary depending on the pitch of\nthe roof.\nThe batten layout is marked on the rafters by placing nails at the line of the batten fronts. The roofing underlay is\nlaid over this, onto the rafters. The battens are then laid from the lowest part of the roof upwards, using the\nmarker nails to locate the front edge of the batten. Remove the marker nails before laying the tiles.\n15.3.2.5 \nRoof Traffic \nMetal Tiles are classified as a Type B Restricted Access roof cladding. Walking on metal tiles indiscriminately\nmay cause considerable damage.\nPersons authorised to walk on a metal tile roof must walk only in the tile's pan, where the batten supports it, and\nwear flat, soft-soled shoes to prevent damage to the tiles and surface coatings.\nOther trades must be made aware by the contractor or site supervisor of the method for walking on pressed\nmetal tiles without causing damage, and that the cost of repairing damaged tiles is their responsibility.\n15.3.2.6 \nFlashings \n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n426\nThis is a controlled document.

They come in two styles, only one of which is used\non any one roof. All flashings and roofing accessories are made of the same base metal as the tiles and are\ncoated the same way.\nLong accessories are typically 2 m long and fixed every 500 mm and there are specific accessories for ridges,\nhips, barges, aprons and walls.\nShort accessories are typically 400 mm long trims and can be used for most flashing applications on a roof.\nSpecial flashings are made as required by the manufacturer or the roofer from uncoated steel, and subsequently\nfactory coated using the same coating process as used for tiles.\n15.3.2.6.1 \nRidge \nTiles must be turned up to a minimum of 40 mm against the battens, hip board, or where they butt\nagainst a vertical or an inclined surface.\nThe ridge trim cap or side flashings must cover the tile turn-ups by a minimum of 35 mm.\nRidge tiles are bent up and then cut to form a turn-up that fits under the ridge/hip cap or short accessory. To\nensure a watertight joint, a tight fit is required between the tile and the ridge cap.\n15.3.2.6.1A Ridge and Hip: Short Trim Installation\nRidge/hip caps\nTile\nTile turn-up\nUnderlay\nRafter\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n427\nThis is a controlled document.

If more than one pallet of tiles is required for one job, the colour uniformity should be checked.\nTiles damaged during installation must be removed and replaced, and any deformed tiles or tiles with surface\ndamage must be rejected.\nThe eave gutter tiles should project over the edge of the fascia to ensure that water discharges directly into the\ngutter system, and tiles should be laid so they prevent any water from penetrating the roof cavity.\nBefore tiles are laid, the direction of lay should be determined, taking into account whether the profile can be laid\nonly one way or both ways.\nDirection of lay may be influenced by a desire to face laps away from major lines of sight, direction of prevailing\nweather, or sequencing of construction.\n15.3.5 \nWorkmanship \nStandard lead pencils contain graphite and must not be used on AZ-coated steel tiles, as graphite can cause\npremature corrosion failure of the coating. \nTile cuts and bends must leave straight lines up the roof section to provide a true line for flashings.\nWhen cutting tiles for their installation at ridges, hips, valleys and barges, avoid damage to the surface finish by\nusing a guillotine or metal shears. When cutting the tile lengthwise, it must be bent before cutting to reduce the\namount of distortion that occurs as the profile is flattened during bending.\nTiles turned up and down for ridges, hips, barges, eaves, and valleys must be bent using a bender specifically\ndesigned for this purpose. Tiles must be turned up at ridges, hips and barges by a minimum of 40 mm, and down\ninto the valleys to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n432\nThis is a controlled document.

With the former,\nsheets clip together, the latter has its side ribs clipped to the adjacent sheet.\nTray roofing designed to be fully supported by sarking is referred to in the COP as standing seam roofing. Clauses\nin this section headed Tray Roofing will apply to both types, clauses headed Standing Seam Roofing, including\nLoad/Span tables, will only apply to generic standing seam roofing profiles\nThe profiles and fixing methods for tray roofing date back to traditional methods used to hand-fabricate metal\nroofs, predominantly in Europe and often from non-ferrous metal, prior to the development of roll forming\ntechnology. A by-product of this heritage is that, in addition to the secret clips fastening the main roof, flashings\nshould also be installed on clips with minimal use of exposed rivets and fasteners.\nIn Europe, the installation of tray roofing is done by Spenglers, who serve a 4-year apprenticeship. We do not have\nthe same qualification in NZ, but installers of tray roofing must have specific training and experience in the\nproduct if they are to achieve the expected high standard of workmanship\n15.4.1 \nTray Roofing Materials \nTraditionally standing seam roofs were manufactured from sheets of copper or pure zinc (sometimes even lead)\nand these materials are still popular being naturally durable and weathering to a natural patina. They are also very\nmalleable which allows more variation in intersections and terminations, and they can be soldered.\nMore common in the New Zealand market are pre-painted steel and aluminium substrates. To increase its\nformability, Steel is normally supplied in Medium Strength G300 grade and Aluminium in hardness grade H34.\nSee 4.16 Materials for a more thorough discussion of roofing material.\n15.4.2 \nTray Roofing Profiles \nSelf-support tray roofing profiles resemble a single tray trough section but the ribs are generally narrower and the\ninstallation techniques are more sophisticated. Standing seam profiles generally have rib heights of 25 mm - 45\nmm. Pan widths for both types vary from 300 mm to 500 mm.\n15.4.2A Typical Self-Supporting Profile\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n433\nThis is a controlled document.

The angle seam is the most\npopular and the double seam is the least popular. The roll cap replicates old roofs with a capped joint installed\nover a longitudinal batten.\nOne of the features of standing seam roofs is that they can be formed by folding rather than roll-forming. This\nmakes it possible to install roofs to buildings that are round or sinusoidal in plan, to have \"random\" pan widths, or\nto vary rib width discretely so that ribs are spaced equidistant from associated architectural features such as\npenetrations and windows.\nAll tray roofing, including standing seam profiles, must have clearance between adjacent pans to allow for timber\nshrinkage and transverse thermal expansion of the pan. The non-existence of this clearance gap can cause\nexcessive canning or quilting.\n15.4.2B Angle Seam\n15.4.2C Double Seam\nClearance\n15.4.2D Standing Seam Roll Cap\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n434\nThis is a controlled document.

Installers\nare generally specialist and highly trained and may modify or improvise a detail to suit the needs of a situation.\nBecause of this, the demarcation between design and Installation is not clear cut.\nThe following information on design and installation is generally applicable to all tray roofing including self-\nsupport, apart from the sections on sarking and load tables. Sections particular to standing seam are headed as\nsuch, but there is a large amount of cross-over in many areas.\n15.4.2E Standing Seam Cladding on a\nSinusoidal Building Plan\nSource: Scope 54, p. 31; NZMRM\n15.4.2F Standing Seam Cladding on a\nRound Building.\n Source: UK Guide to Good Practice in Fully Supported\nMetal Roofing and Cladding 3rd Edition; Federation of\nTraditional Metal Roofing Contractors\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n435\nThis is a controlled document.

Generally, options that work with a trapezoidal profile will equally work\nfor tray roofing but are most likely to be installed on secret grab fasteners rather than being riveted. The\nelimination of primary and secondary fasteners is another attribute abetting weathertightness, as are the tight\nlaps and the water carrying capacity of the wide pan.\nThe wide pan of tray roofing makes it impractical to have longitudinal flashings cover two pans, and because of\nthe vertical rib and fastening techniques, longitudinal flashings covering a single pan are acceptable.\n15.4.5 \nTray Fixings \nPerhaps the most outstanding feature of all tray roofs is the minimisation of visible fasteners. Apart from the\nsecret fixing clips, attachment of flashings to the roof should be achieved by crimping to the cladding or other\nflashings or to a grab flashing wherever possible.\nClips for standing seam roofing are normally single clips, fastened to the substrate with screws or annular\ngrooved nails. The sole of the clips should have a rebated or countersunk hole for the fastener, and rounded\nedges, to ensure thermal movement of the sheet does not cause damage by rubbing against sharp edges.\nWall cladding laid horizontally may need additional support and the standard bracket to resist gravity loads.\n15.4.6 \nStanding Seam End Laps \nAs the style of roofing replicates hand-formed products of yesteryear, and because the sheets themselves are\nrelatively flexible, end laps are more common in tray roofs, and more acceptable, than with other profiles. In\npractice, staggered end laps are often used with tray roofing as an architectural design feature.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n436\nThis is a controlled document.

This puts\nmore responsibility on the designer to consider ventilation of the ceiling space. Ventilation is particularly\nimportant for fully supported profiles; the ply must have a gap at the apex to allow for egress of air and a gap at\nthe bottom, or soffit vents, to allow air ingress. \n15.4.8A Standing Seam Ventilation\nBlocking, spaced to suit \nridge capping\nFelt/shingle or membrane\n25 mm Min air gap\nBlocking (nog)\n10 mm gap for ventilation airflow\nPlywood overhang ventilation to suit \ntimber fascia and gutter or metal \ngutter system.

It can be minimised by\nspecifying a narrower pan width and closing clip centres. Further noise reduction can be gained by putting a\nconcave shape into the pan, which can be achieved by:\ninstalling longitudinal stringers (e.g., a 10 mm batten) under the centre of the tray\ninstalling strips of compressive material along the purlins.\nGeotextile mat layers have the most significant effect on noise attenuation, but the added cost of such should be\nweighed against the expected benefits\n15.4.10 \nPenetrations on Tray Roofing \nThe wide flat pan of tray roofing makes it easy to achieve secure penetration details. Proprietary rubber boot\nflashings can be used for small pipe penetrations, but a more aesthetically pleasing solution is to make up a\nflanged upstand in pre-painted steel or colour matched malleable metal, and fit a \"Chinese hat\" to the penetration\nto allow for thermal movement and weatherproofing.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n439\nThis is a controlled document.

Some people accept it as an innate feature\nof a tray product, others want a flat tray with no visible waviness. It may not be obvious, but it is always present in\ntray roofing to some extent. The visibility of canning is affected as much by the lighting, line of sight, cleanliness,\nand gloss levels of the roof, as it is by the degree of canning present in the product.\nClients expecting no canning should be informed of the reality, particularly if the roof runs at an acute angle to\none's line of sight. Canning can also be induced by stretching the material or excessive foot traffic. The substrate\nmust be true to plane and not convex.\nThe most effective ways to minimise canning in a highly visible situation is to use a profile with a narrower pan\nand use material with a low-gloss or textured surface.\nWith self-support tray roofs, excessive foot traffic will accentuate purlin lines, because of the ductility of the\nmetal (grade G300) and the wide flat pan. \n15.4.13 \nInstalling Tray Cladding \nTray roofing is a predominantly flat, secret fixed profile with one tray per sheet and vertical ribs. The roofing\nsheets are clip-fastened, using hidden clips. Tray cladding which is installed on sarking by traditional methods\nwith hand-formed side lap seams is known as standing seam cladding.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n443\nThis is a controlled document.

Prior to commencing the lay, the roofer must determine what the predominant features are on a given\nface and set the roof out to maximise the symmetry of side flashings and matching rib lines. With fully supported\nprofiles, sheets can be folded to varying widths to achieve symmetry across a number of architectural features.\n15.4.13.2 \nCommence Laying Tray Cladding \n1. Install the eaves grab flashing to which the sheets will be crimped and any other flashings that may be behind\nthe cladding, for example, window jamb flashings.\n2. Fit the netting and/or underlay. On flat roofs requiring underlay support, using twine is preferable to netting as\nthe joins in the latter may imprint through the medium strength iron through foot traffic.\n3. Form stop-ends in the sheets.\n4. Then the sheets can be laid, starting from a distance from the barge to give equal cover distance to the\nopposing barge and other architectural features and penetrations. Fasteners should be annular grooved nails\nor screws, with clips at centres specified by the manufacturer to suit the product and wind zone.\nPre-painted tray roofing will usually be supplied with strippable film to give temporary protection from scratching.\nThe film should be removed from underlaps while laying, and removed entirely before UV sets the adhesive\nmaking it difficult to remove without leaving glue residue on the sheet. Traffic across sheets should be kept to a\nminimum, particularly with self-supporting products.\n15.4.13.3 \nProvision for Expansion - Tray Roofing \nNon-ferrous tray roofing expands at about twice the rate of ferrous metals. Supported angle seam and double\nseam profiles must be installed using a balance of sliding clips to allow for expansion, and fixed clips to\nwithstand gravity loads.\nThe position of the fixed clips depends on the roof pitch. The width of the fixed clip portion should be sufficient\nto install five clips at the required spacing.\n 15 \n 15.4 TRAY ROOFING\n 15 \n 15.4 \n444\nThis is a controlled document.

It can be divided into three main\ncategories:\ninsulated panels,\ncomposite or site assembled systems, and\nroofs with insulation sprayed on after installation.\n15.5.1 \nInsulated Panels \nInsulated or sandwich panels are factory-made laminated products using different core materials permanently\nbonded by adhesive or foam to metal skins to act as a single structural element.\n15.5.1.1 \nInsulated Panel Manufacturing \nThe manufacturing process for bonded panels consists of roll forming the flat or profiled sheeting,\nfollowed by the adhesion of the insulation core to both surfaces or skins.\nThere are three methods to do this:\nContinuous production by injecting foaming insulation between 2 metal skins as they are being\nroll-formed.\nContinuous production by glueing pre-formed panels of insulation to roll-formed metal skins.\nIndividual panel production by glueing insulated panels to roll-formed sheets\nBonded composite panels develop their strength from the sandwich of skins and insulation, and are\nmade with a tongue and groove side lap detail that incorporates concealed fasteners.\n15.5.1.2 \nInsulated Panel Composition \nThe structure and composition of an insulated panel are chiefly determined by its end use.\n15.5.1.3 \nInsulated Panel Face Profiles \n Three types of profiles are used on insulated panels.

Panning can be minimised by using a matt finish or\nforming minor ribs or swages on the flat face of the panel.\n15.5.1.4 \nInsulated Panel Face Materials \nThe facings or skins of composite panels are typically metallic coated, pre-painted steel or\naluminium, and are either profiled or flat on either or both sides of the panel. The internal skin is\nalso known as the liner skin or sheeting.\nThe metal facing is commonly made from grade G300 steel of 0.40 - 0.63 BMT thickness, with a pre-\npainted organic finish over a metallic coating. Cool room panels have a galvanised Z275 metallic\ncoating, while interior/exterior structural insulated panels have an aluminium/zinc coating of\nAZ150 or AZ200. Paint coatings are specifically developed to assist in bonding the insulation to the\npanel\nAluminium facings are used in very humid conditions or severe marine environments and can be\nsupplied plain or pre-painted.\n15.5.1.5 \nInsulated Panel Core Materials \n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n448\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common are EPS (Expanded Polystyrene), PPS (Phenolic/Polystyrene), PIR\n(Polyisocyanurate), and mineral fibre.\nEPS\nEPS foam is mainly used for applications where high fire resistance is not a requirement.\nPPS\nPPS may be used where greater fire resistance is required.\nPIR\nPIR foam is increasingly specified because of its fire-resistant properties and better insulation\nefficiency.\nMineral Fibre\nMineral-fibre insulation may be selected for applications where fire resistance and/or acoustic\ninsulation properties are of prime importance.\n15.5.1.6 \nInsulation Panel Insulation Values \nThe insulation thickness of a profiled roof panel varies from 30 mm to 300 mm. To achieve the same insulating\nvalue as a flat panel, a profiled roof panel needs to be thicker. The through fasteners or fixing clips are thermal\nbridges, but it has been shown that these are unlikely to decrease the R-value by more than 2%.\nDifferent cores will also have different values for thermal insulation and noise attenuation, as will the details of\npanel joints and interfaces with other materials.\nThe manufacturer must calculate and state the net insulation value of a panel.\n R-values are the reciprocal of U-values. We will stick with R-value because that is the most commonly used value\nfor roofs and walls.\n15.5.1.7 \nInsulation Panel Structure \nInsulated panels are integral units in which the insulation layer together with the two metal skins act as a beam to\nresist wind and point loads. The bonded insulation core material contributes to the panel's strength by effectively\nincreasing the web depth of the profile and resisting buckling; the depth of the core largely determines the panel's\nresistance to deflection. Panel stiffness is also affected by skin thickness and profile shape.\nInsulated panels are excellent at supporting normal foot traffic without damage because the foam core provides\ncontinuous support to the external sheeting. The number and strength of the fasteners under wind suction loads\ncan limit the maximum purlin spacing.\n15.5.1.8 \nNatural Lighting for Insulated Panels \n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n449\nThis is a controlled document.

Polycarbonate or G.R.P. barrel vault roof lighting may be\nused for greater spans or proprietary systems may be supplied by the manufacturer.\n15.5.1.9 \nInsulated Panel Acoustics \nInsulated panels do not have inherently good acoustic insulation properties. Sound can be lessened by using\nsealed joints, but where higher levels of acoustic attenuation or absorption are required, it may be necessary to\ninstall additional acoustic lining systems.\n15.5.1.10 \nInsulated Panels and Internal Moisture \nMetal facings are effectively impervious to penetration by vapour, and panel cores have a closed\ncell structure which does not permit significant transmission or absorption of vapour. However, to\nprevent the possibility of interstitial condensation, it is necessary to fasten and seal all laps and\ngaps, side-lap joints, transverse laps, and joints and ridges that are exposed to the internal\nenvironment.\nWhen insulated panels are used as cold store insulation, a complete and continuous vapour barrier\nis essential to prevent inward moisture vapour pressure. Any discontinuity will result in a build-up\nof ice which can destroy the panel.\nThe bottom skins of composite panels have an integral side lap with a re-entrant sealing space\nwhich acts as a vapour control, but in high-risk applications such as food processing buildings,\ntextile mills, and indoor swimming pools an additional sealer strip is required in the side lap joint.\n15.5.1.11 \nInsulated Panels Fitness for Purpose \nThermal bowing can occur when the two skins are at significantly different temperatures such as north-facing\nwalls, e.g., when a cool room roof panel is in direct sunshine. The effect is accentuated when the external surface\nis a dark colour and is more severe for aluminium facings.\n15.5.1.12 \nInsulated Panel Installation \nThe use of insulated panels for roof and wall cladding requires the same or similar detailing for Structure,\nDurability, External Moisture, and other design considerations as those for single-skin roof and wall cladding.\n15.5.1.13 \nInsulated Panel Installation Safety \nIn most applications insulated panels can be installed by workers operating off the already installed sheet,\nnegating the need for safely mesh. Many panels are installed using underslung safety nets. Other than that, all\nsafety precautions should be followed as for any other cladding material.\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n450\nThis is a controlled document.

Insulated\npanels are supported on purlins or girts, which should be accurately erected to a maximum tolerance of 3 mm and\na deflection limit of l/600.\n15.5.1.15 \nInsulated Panel Penetrations \nInsulated panels can accommodate penetration openings of 350 mm diameter or 300 mm square without the\nneed for additional structural supports or trimmers. Where larger holes are required, trimmers should be in place\nbefore the erection of the panels.\n15.5.1.16 \nFixing Insulated Panels \nPurpose-designed high thread-type fasteners are required to spread upwards loads and maintain the weather seal\nbetween the metal skin and the washer. Through fixings for roof panels may be rib fixed or located on a mini-rib\nwithin the trough, and should be set snugly to achieve a weatherproof seal without distorting the rib profile. Care\nmust be taken not to over-drive the fasteners as this can cause damage to the G300 outer skin of the panel which\ncan result in water ingress issues\nInsulated roof panels with trapezoidal ribs are through-fixed with a load spreading washer on the rib and require\nlap fixing and sealing at the side laps to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n15.5.1.17 \nInsulated Panel End Laps \nThe maximum practical length of panels for transport and handling efficiency is restricted to approximately 25 m.\nWhere a transverse joint is required, there are two options:\nButt End Lap\nWaterfall Junction\nButt End Lap\nThe lining and insulation are butt-jointed over the purlin, and a 150 mm overlap of the top sheet is formed in the\nexternal weather skin only, using three or more lines of sealant and fasteners. The sealant should be butyl tape,\nsilicone or MS sealant, or self-adhesive closed cell tape according to the specifications of the manufacturer and\nshould be positioned at the top and bottom of the lap. To provide a secure seal with flat or wide pan profiles,\nadditional sealed rivets or stitching screws are required through the top skins only.\nThe challenge with this detail is that there are four layers of material to consider at the side/end junction. While\nsuccessful in many instances, problems developing later are very difficult to remedy.\nWaterfall Junction\nA waterfall step can be achieved by putting a step in the rafter or by increasing purlin cleat heights,\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n451\nThis is a controlled document.

The second challenge is that any gap between the upper and\nlower sheets must be adequately insulated to ensure that the thermal efficiency of the system is not\ncompromised.\n15.5.1.18 \nInsulated Panel Flashings \nFlashings detailing is similar to that used with single-skin roof and wall cladding. The main exception is that\ninternal joints should be designed and sealed so that water vapour cannot impregnate the system.\nThe panels at the ridge and other edges of the roof should be sealed and the lining closed with a metal trim\nmounted on the ridge purlins as detailed by the manufacturer. Any gap between the ends of the composite panels\nshould be insulated to eliminate cold spots or cold bridging. They can be sealed using in-situ injected foam or\nmineral fibre. In high-humidity applications, the liner trim should be sealed to the panels. At end-laps or gaps,\nfoam should be injected to provide a vapour-tight seal.\nWhere required by the manufacturer, eaves panels should have the ends turned down to prevent capillary action\non the underside of the sheet. A metal flashing may also be installed to cover the exposed end of the insulation\nand metal liner when panel ends are visually exposed.\n15.5.1.18A Insulated Panels Ridge Detail\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel ridge flashing\nProfiled filler \nsealed top \nand bottom\n25 mm\nEmbossed\nwasher\nRidge \nnotched \ninto profile\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel closure \nflashing\nPurlin\n5 mm\nGap\nRoof panel\nTurn up panel end\nFill Gaps with\nfoam filler\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n452\nThis is a controlled document.

They are not a true warm\nroof, as the ribs are typically not in contact with the insulation, but they have many of the same attributes as\nwarm roofs.\nThe mechanics of a composite system's performance are complex. Consideration must be given at the design\nstage to ensure the system is suitable for a particular end use. This would include consideration of various\naspects, including practicality of installation, durability of components, thermal performance, and control of\ninternal and interstitial moisture.\nThe advantages of composite systems are that they offer longer runs without the need for roof laps or waterfall\njunctions, and when the time comes for the replacement of the outer weather-proofing roof sheet, the system\nallows for it to be done without disturbance to the operations within the building.\nAcoustic boards can be laid within the system to increase sound absorption either from within the building or\nfrom outside. Installation of the under-liner sheets can make a building largely watertight, allowing other trades to\ncontinue below while the roof is completed.\n15.5.2.1 \nComposite Systems Composistion \nThere are three main types.\nBespoke systems that incorporate layers of material and insulation above the purlin.\nProprietary systems that are built up by layer above the purlin, such systems can be sandwich-type or post and\nrail.\nOverlay systems that are used for re-roofs over existing roofing.\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n455\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nComposite systems typically incorporate a sealed vapour control layer under the insulating layer, and an\nabsorbent roofing underlay under the top skin. They may be designed as closed systems, or ventilation may be\nintroduced between the insulation and the top surface. The insulation material may be expanded foam, mineral\nwool, or fibreglass blanket. Top surfaces may be profiled metal or membrane.\nPost and rail systems allow thicker insulation to be used, increasing thermal and fire performance.\n15.5.2.2 \nComposite System Installation \nComposite systems are normally laid layer by layer to form the desired system. Typically, they comprise a metal\nbase layer to provide support for the insulation, which is overlaid by a vapour check layer, insulation, underlay, and\nthe top roofing sheet.\nPost and rail systems are often used for overlaying existing roofs in good, safe condition. Another form of\noverlay uses custom-cut blocks as pan infills, over which is laid a continuous insulating layer. These forms of\nroof repair avoid the need for removal and replacement of an existing roof, allowing the building tenants'\noperations to continue uninterrupted.\nWhen installing composite systems, it is important that the vapour control layer is correctly installed and sealed\nto the manufacturer's requirements, and insulation is laid correctly without gaps. Bulk insulation must be able to\nloft up to its design thickness to achieve the design R-value.\nThese systems have a heavy reliance on accurate installation for them to meet their design expectations.\n15.5.2.2A Typical Composite Roof Unvented\nTop Deck\nSynthetic underlay\nPIR board\nLiner deck\nVapour layer\nAcoustic \nboard\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n456\nThis is a controlled document.

It can also be applied to walls, ceilings, and under floors. Spray foam may be applied to any roofing\nprofile. It has a greater insulation value per millimetre than other insulation materials, so is particularly suitable\nfor flat roofs and skillion roofs where there is limited air space.\nSpray foam is non-absorbent (less than 1%) and has strong contact with all adjacent building elements. This\nmakes it an effective vapour check, so internal moisture issues must be considered when using this or any other\nnon-permeable system.\n15.5.3.1 \nVentilation of Spray-on Systems \nWhen sprayed foam is applied directly to the underside of profiled metal sheet roofing on a lined building, the\nceiling space must be adequately ventilated by other means.

Check the building to confirm that the wrap is not loose or floppy, is properly attached to the studs, and\nis not sagging between purlins.\n2. Spray a \"flash-coat\" of Polyurethane Spray Foam over the building wrap or cladding contacting the timber\nor metal framing. Allow to set - it will take 5-10 minutes depending on the ambient conditions. The \"Flash-\ncoat\" will tension the building wrap, give it some rigidity, and assist with the curing and adhesion of\nsubsequent layers.\n3. Spray the first pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam onto the flash-coat. Do not exceed 25-30 mm with this\npass. This will render the building wrap/foam composite rigid and able to take the balance of the foam\nwith no distortion.\n4. Spray the second pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam to the desired thickness to achieve the required R-\nvalue (or up to a maximum of 100mm per pass).\n15.5.3.1A Spray-on Foam with Underlay\nRoof cladding\nUnderlay\nTop chord \nor rafter\nSpray-on \nfoam\n15.5.3.1B Spray-on Foam without Underlay\nDPC\nover\npurlin\nRoof \ncladding\nTop chord or rafter\nSpray-on foam\n 15 \n 15.5 WARM ROOFS\n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n459\nThis is a controlled document.

Draped sheets, known as spring curving.\n2. Pre-curved sheets, either roll-curved or crimp-curved.\nThe system used depends on the design of the structure and the selected profile. Spring curving can be used on\nwider radii, while pre-curving can generally be done down to a 300mm or 400mm radius.\nCurved flashings are described in 8.5.5 Curved Flashings\n15.1.1 \nSide Laps: Curved Roofs \nThe minimum pitch for curved roofs may differ from that otherwise recommended for the profile.\nFor barrel curved roofs, the lap sealed section over the apex is exempt from minimum pitch requirements,\nprovided that the required minimum pitch is achieved at the eaves. For mono-pitch curved roofs terminating at a\ntransverse apron or head barge, the minimum pitch at the apex is 5 deg for corrugate or 3 deg for other profiles. Where\nthis is less than the normal recommended for the profile, flashing cover must be increased to the next higher\ncategory in accordance with guidelines in 8.4 Flashing Cover.\nThis limitation does not apply to roofs outside of the building envelope, such as curved verandah roofs, provided\nany spill-over is unable to penetrate the structure.\nSelect your profile, then enter either the height or desired radius in the calculator below to determine the length of\nthe seal.\nThe Code of Practice Online provides an interactive tool for these calculations.

Transverse laps should be\nsealed at both edges to prevent the ingress of both rainwater and condensation, in accordance with 14.11.1\nSealing End Laps.\n15.1.3 \nPenetrations: Curved Roofs \nPenetrations should be placed at the apex, or where the pitch is greater than the minimum for the profile.\n15.1.4 \nVentilation: Curved Roofs \nBarrel curved roofs have no ridging to allow water vapour to exit at the ridge, so other means of venting the\nceiling space should be considered. (See 10.10 Ventilation Pathways.)\n15.1.5 \nThermal Expansion: Curved Roofs \nProvision for expansion should be provided in the same manner as required for straight lengths, but the\nconfiguration of curved roofs means that some expansion will be taken up by a springing of the profile further up,\nwhich results in less movement. When the total sheet length is considered for expansion, positive fixing should\nbe used at the crown, and provision for expansion accommodated on the slopes. Sealed and fastened end laps\ndo not act as an expansion joint.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n413\nThis is a controlled document.

Therefore, it needs to be washed and regularly maintained to comply with the durability\nrequirements of the NZBC and the supplier's warranty. Because pre-painted cladding is not intended for use in this\ntype of micro-climate without regular maintenance, the underside of the soffit should be lined in all severe and\nvery severe environments. (see 16 Maintenance )\n15.1.7 \nSpring Curving \nSpring curving, also known as draping or arching of roofs, is a method of providing continuous lengths of roof\ncladding over a curved roof structure without pre-curving the sheets. It is best suited to corrugated profiles, or\nsymmetrical roofing profiles of low rib height and narrow pan width, which can follow a curve without excessive\npanning or distortion. Asymmetrical rib products have greater minimum radii, which are limited by their pan width\nand rib height.\nBecause symmetrical profiles do not have a large rain-water carrying capacity they are limited in maximum radius\nand length. Maximum radius is limited by the need to provide adequate drainage at the top of the curvature and\nminimum radius is limited by the need to avoid distortion without pre-forming.\nContinuity over a minimum of three purlins is required for successful spring curving and therefore any interruption\nsuch as a penetration may affect the ability of the sheet to drape curve.\nPurlins must be accurately positioned with the top faces tangential to the radius of the arch and should be within\na 5 mm tolerance to avoid purlin creasing. Roof traffic should be restricted to avoid damage, particularly in the\nlow pitched region or in highly visible areas, particularly in the low-pitched region or in highly visible areas. Some\npurlin creasing or canning is to be expected with stronger profiles at minimum radii.\nFor convex roofs, the minimum radii should be adhered to because the pans are in compression, whereas with\nconcave roofs the pans are in tension and the panning or distortion of these roofs will be less.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n414\nThis is a controlled document.

When the base chord is on an incline, the maximum radius can be increased.\nThe two top purlins should be spaced to enable the sheeting to follow an arc that minimises purlin marking.\n15.1.7D Top Purlin Positioning for Spring Curved Roofs\nDraped curved roofs or curved ridges should be fixed by fastening each sheet first to one side of the roof and then\npulling it down to be fixed on the other side. Where sheets are end-lapped, alternate sheets should be laid in\nsequence to avoid cumulative errors and be laid from opposite sides of the roof to ensure squareness is\nmaintained.\nBecause extra uplift load will be imposed on the end fasteners of convex spring curved roofs, through the\ntorsional action of the sheets on the fasteners, screws and load spreading washers should be used on the\npenultimate and the last purlins.

Setting\nout requires first checking that the materials delivered on site are within specified tolerances, and before\ncommencing work the building should be checked for squareness.\nBoth roll curving and crimp curving will produce a curve with the effective cover dictated by the forming process. \nIt is critical that the material is run to the correct width before being presented to the curving tool, or the effective\ncover of the straight portion will not match that of the curve. A variation of only 2mm between the straight and\ncurved portion of a sheet will make it very difficult, or impossible, to install.\nThe curving process can cause dimensional changes, which can lead to misalignment, so the sheets should be\nkept square with the building. Some minor saw-toothing at the gutter end is to be expected when fitting curved\nsheeting. When multiple curves are required that cannot be provided on one sheet, the sheets should be fixed in\nthe order shown below.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n419\nThis is a controlled document.

Pre-curved corrugated roof cladding is used for bull-nosed\nveranda roofs, ridges, or roofs where the radius is less than the minimum required for sprung or draped curved\nroofs.\nThe sheets are passed through offset curving rolls, which progressively form curves in a wide range of radii down\nto 300 mm. There is, however, a straight portion of about 80 mm at each end of the sheet which may need to be\ntrimmed off if a true curve is required.\nCircular barns have been successfully clad with 0.4 mm steel for many years, but 0.55 mm steel or 0.9 mm\naluminium should be used for roll-curved roofs subject to foot traffic. As roll curving is normally done with G300\nsteel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials must be taken into account when setting\npurlin spacings.\nIf the edge of the sheet is too flat or long, and at tight radii, rippled edges may result, and these should be dressed\nout using a dressing tool, or trimmed off before the sheet is installed.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n420\nThis is a controlled document.

The radius can be altered by the\nspacing of the crimps and the angle of the bend by the number of crimps.\nAs crimp Curving is normally done with G300 steel or H34 aluminium, the lower yield strength of these materials\nmust be taken into account when setting purlin spacings.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 1 \n 15 \n 15.1 \n421\nThis is a controlled document.

This may be an organic paint coating applied by either the steel manufacturer before the tiles are\nformed, or by the tile manufacturer after the tiles are formed. An alternative (and traditional) coating can be\nprovided by applying crushed stone or ceramic granules (\"chip\") to the base metallic-coated steel, which is\nattached by an adhesive coating; normally, a clear acrylic coat over the chip coating. Post-applied coating also\nprovides cut-edge protection.\nPressed metal roofing tiles are installed by nominated agent fixers, trained and appointed by the manufacturers or\ntheir representatives. They are not normally supplied to other installers.\n15.3.1.1 \nDurability \nThe principles behind requirements for fixings, flashings, corrosion, compatibility, and maintenance as described\nelsewhere in this COP should also apply to the design and installation of pressed metal tiles.\nFasteners must be compatible with the base metal and provide a service life equivalent to the durability of the\npanel. Typically, these are coated hot-dipped galvanised steel nails.\n15.3.1.2 \nStructure \nMetal tiles must be installed to battens selected, spaced, and attached as per the manufacturer's requirements.\nPanels are fastened to the roof structure by fixing horizontally through the front of the panel, and because the\nfixings are in shear, they provide wind uplift resistance suitable for very high wind design loads.\n15.3.1.3 \nMinimum Pitch \nTiles with a minimum upstand of 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 12 deg or more. Tiles with an\nupstand of less than 25 mm may be laid on roof structures with a pitch of 15 deg or more. Typically, these are tiles\nwith a shingle or shake form.\nThe manufacturer may stipulate greater or lesser minimum pitches for specific designs.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n423\nThis is a controlled document.

The pitch of the roof is not the same as the pitch of the tiles. It varies with the height of the batten\nand the height of the upstand.\n15.3.1.4 \nValleys \nValley gutters must be made of the same metal or coating as the roof tiles or a compatible material.\nValleys must have a minimum upstand of 20 mm and a width of 80 mm. For valley sizing, see 5.5.7\nValley Capacity Calculator.\nValley boards are required to support a point load of 1.1 kN, which approximates the weight of a\ntradesperson with a bag of tools.\n15.3.1.5 \nLongrun Tiles \nLongrun tiles are a hybrid roof cladding with the appearance of pressed metal tile. This is achieved by pressing\nsteps into a length of long run profiled steel, so horizontal laps are minimised or eliminated.\nLongrun tiles are not currently manufactured in New Zealand.\n15.3.2 \nInstallation \nPressed metal roofing tiles are only installed by specifically trained and accredited installers. As the battens go\nover the roofing overlay, the installer is responsible for doing the battens, as well as the underlay and the roof\ncladding.\n15.3.2.1 \nRoof Framing \nRoof framing should provide support and fixing for the tile battens that will satisfy the design wind load\nrequirements. Installers should check that the framing has been erected to an accurate and even line before fixing\nthe roof\n15.3.2.2 \nValley Installation \nValleys are installed so water discharges over the fascia and into the eaves gutter. The valleys are held in\nposition by clips specially designed to allow for expansion, or by compatible nails and washers placed alongside\nthe valley or bent over the top lip of the valley.\nUnder no circumstances must the fasteners penetrate the sole of the valley. The top end of the valley should be\nturned up against the hip or ridge battens to the height of the batten. Where two valleys meet over a dormer, they\nare cut, shaped, joined, and sealed so that they form a continuous valley.\nThe tile edge should be bent down to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\nThe gap between tiles on opposing sides of the valley must be a minimum of 70 mm.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n424\nThis is a controlled document.

The exception is at the eaves, where it is laid over the eaves batten\nand the fascia.

Battens at different centres may require different values.\n Battens must have square cut ends and must be butt jointed over the centre line of the rafter.\nAdjacent rows of battens must not be joined on the same rafter and must span at least three rafter spacings at\nthe roof edge.\nA batten must be installed immediately behind the fascia as fixing for the eaves tiles.\nBecause an eaves-tile batten is installed directly behind the fascia, the position of the next batten up the rafter will\nbe less than that of the normal tile batten spacing. The position of this batten may vary depending on the pitch of\nthe roof.\nThe batten layout is marked on the rafters by placing nails at the line of the batten fronts. The roofing underlay is\nlaid over this, onto the rafters. The battens are then laid from the lowest part of the roof upwards, using the\nmarker nails to locate the front edge of the batten. Remove the marker nails before laying the tiles.\n15.3.2.5 \nRoof Traffic \nMetal Tiles are classified as a Type B Restricted Access roof cladding. Walking on metal tiles indiscriminately\nmay cause considerable damage.\nPersons authorised to walk on a metal tile roof must walk only in the tile's pan, where the batten supports it, and\nwear flat, soft-soled shoes to prevent damage to the tiles and surface coatings.\nOther trades must be made aware by the contractor or site supervisor of the method for walking on pressed\nmetal tiles without causing damage, and that the cost of repairing damaged tiles is their responsibility.\n15.3.2.6 \nFlashings \n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n426\nThis is a controlled document.

They come in two styles, only one of which is used\non any one roof. All flashings and roofing accessories are made of the same base metal as the tiles and are\ncoated the same way.\nLong accessories are typically 2 m long and fixed every 500 mm and there are specific accessories for ridges,\nhips, barges, aprons and walls.\nShort accessories are typically 400 mm long trims and can be used for most flashing applications on a roof.\nSpecial flashings are made as required by the manufacturer or the roofer from uncoated steel, and subsequently\nfactory coated using the same coating process as used for tiles.\n15.3.2.6.1 \nRidge \nTiles must be turned up to a minimum of 40 mm against the battens, hip board, or where they butt\nagainst a vertical or an inclined surface.\nThe ridge trim cap or side flashings must cover the tile turn-ups by a minimum of 35 mm.\nRidge tiles are bent up and then cut to form a turn-up that fits under the ridge/hip cap or short accessory.

When the construction is solid masonry or brickwork, and flashings cannot\nbe installed under the wall cladding, a chased should be cut and an over-flashing installed in the chase to provide\nweather protection.\n15.3.3 \nSitework \nThe requirements of 8.11 Safety and 14.1 Pre-Installationalso apply to the installation of metal tiles.

If more than one pallet of tiles is required for one job, the colour uniformity should be checked.\nTiles damaged during installation must be removed and replaced, and any deformed tiles or tiles with surface\ndamage must be rejected.\nThe eave gutter tiles should project over the edge of the fascia to ensure that water discharges directly into the\ngutter system, and tiles should be laid so they prevent any water from penetrating the roof cavity.\nBefore tiles are laid, the direction of lay should be determined, taking into account whether the profile can be laid\nonly one way or both ways.\nDirection of lay may be influenced by a desire to face laps away from major lines of sight, direction of prevailing\nweather, or sequencing of construction.\n15.3.5 \nWorkmanship \nStandard lead pencils contain graphite and must not be used on AZ-coated steel tiles, as graphite can cause\npremature corrosion failure of the coating. \nTile cuts and bends must leave straight lines up the roof section to provide a true line for flashings.\nWhen cutting tiles for their installation at ridges, hips, valleys and barges, avoid damage to the surface finish by\nusing a guillotine or metal shears. When cutting the tile lengthwise, it must be bent before cutting to reduce the\namount of distortion that occurs as the profile is flattened during bending.\nTiles turned up and down for ridges, hips, barges, eaves, and valleys must be bent using a bender specifically\ndesigned for this purpose. Tiles must be turned up at ridges, hips and barges by a minimum of 40 mm, and down\ninto the valleys to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n432\nThis is a controlled document.

For valley sizing, see 5.5.7\nValley Capacity Calculator.\nValley boards are required to support a point load of 1.1 kN, which approximates the weight of a\ntradesperson with a bag of tools.\n15.3.1.5 \nLongrun Tiles \nLongrun tiles are a hybrid roof cladding with the appearance of pressed metal tile. This is achieved by pressing\nsteps into a length of long run profiled steel, so horizontal laps are minimised or eliminated.\nLongrun tiles are not currently manufactured in New Zealand.\n15.3.2 \nInstallation \nPressed metal roofing tiles are only installed by specifically trained and accredited installers. As the battens go\nover the roofing overlay, the installer is responsible for doing the battens, as well as the underlay and the roof\ncladding.\n15.3.2.1 \nRoof Framing \nRoof framing should provide support and fixing for the tile battens that will satisfy the design wind load\nrequirements. Installers should check that the framing has been erected to an accurate and even line before fixing\nthe roof\n15.3.2.2 \nValley Installation \nValleys are installed so water discharges over the fascia and into the eaves gutter. The valleys are held in\nposition by clips specially designed to allow for expansion, or by compatible nails and washers placed alongside\nthe valley or bent over the top lip of the valley.\nUnder no circumstances must the fasteners penetrate the sole of the valley. The top end of the valley should be\nturned up against the hip or ridge battens to the height of the batten. Where two valleys meet over a dormer, they\nare cut, shaped, joined, and sealed so that they form a continuous valley.\nThe tile edge should be bent down to a minimum of 5 mm from the valley floor.\nThe gap between tiles on opposing sides of the valley must be a minimum of 70 mm.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15.3 PRESSED METAL TILES\n 3 \n 15 \n 15.3 \n424\nThis is a controlled document.

With the former,\nsheets clip together, the latter has its side ribs clipped to the adjacent sheet.\nTray roofing designed to be fully supported by sarking is referred to in the COP as standing seam roofing. Clauses\nin this section headed Tray Roofing will apply to both types, clauses headed Standing Seam Roofing, including\nLoad/Span tables, will only apply to generic standing seam roofing profiles\nThe profiles and fixing methods for tray roofing date back to traditional methods used to hand-fabricate metal\nroofs, predominantly in Europe and often from non-ferrous metal, prior to the development of roll forming\ntechnology. A by-product of this heritage is that, in addition to the secret clips fastening the main roof, flashings\nshould also be installed on clips with minimal use of exposed rivets and fasteners.\nIn Europe, the installation of tray roofing is done by Spenglers, who serve a 4-year apprenticeship. We do not have\nthe same qualification in NZ, but installers of tray roofing must have specific training and experience in the\nproduct if they are to achieve the expected high standard of workmanship\n15.4.1 \nTray Roofing Materials \nTraditionally standing seam roofs were manufactured from sheets of copper or pure zinc (sometimes even lead)\nand these materials are still popular being naturally durable and weathering to a natural patina. They are also very\nmalleable which allows more variation in intersections and terminations, and they can be soldered.\nMore common in the New Zealand market are pre-painted steel and aluminium substrates. To increase its\nformability, Steel is normally supplied in Medium Strength G300 grade and Aluminium in hardness grade H34.\nSee 4.16 Materials for a more thorough discussion of roofing material.\n15.4.2 \nTray Roofing Profiles \nSelf-support tray roofing profiles resemble a single tray trough section but the ribs are generally narrower and the\ninstallation techniques are more sophisticated. Standing seam profiles generally have rib heights of 25 mm - 45\nmm. Pan widths for both types vary from 300 mm to 500 mm.\n15.4.2A Typical Self-Supporting Profile\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n433\nThis is a controlled document.

The angle seam is the most\npopular and the double seam is the least popular. The roll cap replicates old roofs with a capped joint installed\nover a longitudinal batten.\nOne of the features of standing seam roofs is that they can be formed by folding rather than roll-forming. This\nmakes it possible to install roofs to buildings that are round or sinusoidal in plan, to have \"random\" pan widths, or\nto vary rib width discretely so that ribs are spaced equidistant from associated architectural features such as\npenetrations and windows.\nAll tray roofing, including standing seam profiles, must have clearance between adjacent pans to allow for timber\nshrinkage and transverse thermal expansion of the pan. The non-existence of this clearance gap can cause\nexcessive canning or quilting.\n15.4.2B Angle Seam\n15.4.2C Double Seam\nClearance\n15.4.2D Standing Seam Roll Cap\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n434\nThis is a controlled document.

Installers\nare generally specialist and highly trained and may modify or improvise a detail to suit the needs of a situation.\nBecause of this, the demarcation between design and Installation is not clear cut.\nThe following information on design and installation is generally applicable to all tray roofing including self-\nsupport, apart from the sections on sarking and load tables. Sections particular to standing seam are headed as\nsuch, but there is a large amount of cross-over in many areas.\n15.4.2E Standing Seam Cladding on a\nSinusoidal Building Plan\nSource: Scope 54, p. 31; NZMRM\n15.4.2F Standing Seam Cladding on a\nRound Building.\n Source: UK Guide to Good Practice in Fully Supported\nMetal Roofing and Cladding 3rd Edition; Federation of\nTraditional Metal Roofing Contractors\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n435\nThis is a controlled document.

Generally, options that work with a trapezoidal profile will equally work\nfor tray roofing but are most likely to be installed on secret grab fasteners rather than being riveted. The\nelimination of primary and secondary fasteners is another attribute abetting weathertightness, as are the tight\nlaps and the water carrying capacity of the wide pan.\nThe wide pan of tray roofing makes it impractical to have longitudinal flashings cover two pans, and because of\nthe vertical rib and fastening techniques, longitudinal flashings covering a single pan are acceptable.\n15.4.5 \nTray Fixings \nPerhaps the most outstanding feature of all tray roofs is the minimisation of visible fasteners. Apart from the\nsecret fixing clips, attachment of flashings to the roof should be achieved by crimping to the cladding or other\nflashings or to a grab flashing wherever possible.\nClips for standing seam roofing are normally single clips, fastened to the substrate with screws or annular\ngrooved nails. The sole of the clips should have a rebated or countersunk hole for the fastener, and rounded\nedges, to ensure thermal movement of the sheet does not cause damage by rubbing against sharp edges.\nWall cladding laid horizontally may need additional support and the standard bracket to resist gravity loads.\n15.4.6 \nStanding Seam End Laps \nAs the style of roofing replicates hand-formed products of yesteryear, and because the sheets themselves are\nrelatively flexible, end laps are more common in tray roofs, and more acceptable, than with other profiles. In\npractice, staggered end laps are often used with tray roofing as an architectural design feature.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n436\nThis is a controlled document.

This puts\nmore responsibility on the designer to consider ventilation of the ceiling space. Ventilation is particularly\nimportant for fully supported profiles; the ply must have a gap at the apex to allow for egress of air and a gap at\nthe bottom, or soffit vents, to allow air ingress. \n15.4.8A Standing Seam Ventilation\nBlocking, spaced to suit \nridge capping\nFelt/shingle or membrane\n25 mm Min air gap\nBlocking (nog)\n10 mm gap for ventilation airflow\nPlywood overhang ventilation to suit \ntimber fascia and gutter or metal \ngutter system.

It can be minimised by\nspecifying a narrower pan width and closing clip centres. Further noise reduction can be gained by putting a\nconcave shape into the pan, which can be achieved by:\ninstalling longitudinal stringers (e.g., a 10 mm batten) under the centre of the tray\ninstalling strips of compressive material along the purlins.\nGeotextile mat layers have the most significant effect on noise attenuation, but the added cost of such should be\nweighed against the expected benefits\n15.4.10 \nPenetrations on Tray Roofing \nThe wide flat pan of tray roofing makes it easy to achieve secure penetration details. Proprietary rubber boot\nflashings can be used for small pipe penetrations, but a more aesthetically pleasing solution is to make up a\nflanged upstand in pre-painted steel or colour matched malleable metal, and fit a \"Chinese hat\" to the penetration\nto allow for thermal movement and weatherproofing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n439\nThis is a controlled document.

Some people accept it as an innate feature\nof a tray product, others want a flat tray with no visible waviness. It may not be obvious, but it is always present in\ntray roofing to some extent. The visibility of canning is affected as much by the lighting, line of sight, cleanliness,\nand gloss levels of the roof, as it is by the degree of canning present in the product.\nClients expecting no canning should be informed of the reality, particularly if the roof runs at an acute angle to\none's line of sight. Canning can also be induced by stretching the material or excessive foot traffic. The substrate\nmust be true to plane and not convex.\nThe most effective ways to minimise canning in a highly visible situation is to use a profile with a narrower pan\nand use material with a low-gloss or textured surface.\nWith self-support tray roofs, excessive foot traffic will accentuate purlin lines, because of the ductility of the\nmetal (grade G300) and the wide flat pan. \n15.4.13 \nInstalling Tray Cladding \nTray roofing is a predominantly flat, secret fixed profile with one tray per sheet and vertical ribs. The roofing\nsheets are clip-fastened, using hidden clips. Tray cladding which is installed on sarking by traditional methods\nwith hand-formed side lap seams is known as standing seam cladding.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n443\nThis is a controlled document.

Prior to commencing the lay, the roofer must determine what the predominant features are on a given\nface and set the roof out to maximise the symmetry of side flashings and matching rib lines. With fully supported\nprofiles, sheets can be folded to varying widths to achieve symmetry across a number of architectural features.\n15.4.13.2 \nCommence Laying Tray Cladding \n1. Install the eaves grab flashing to which the sheets will be crimped and any other flashings that may be behind\nthe cladding, for example, window jamb flashings.\n2. Fit the netting and/or underlay. On flat roofs requiring underlay support, using twine is preferable to netting as\nthe joins in the latter may imprint through the medium strength iron through foot traffic.\n3. Form stop-ends in the sheets.\n4. Then the sheets can be laid, starting from a distance from the barge to give equal cover distance to the\nopposing barge and other architectural features and penetrations. Fasteners should be annular grooved nails\nor screws, with clips at centres specified by the manufacturer to suit the product and wind zone.\nPre-painted tray roofing will usually be supplied with strippable film to give temporary protection from scratching.\nThe film should be removed from underlaps while laying, and removed entirely before UV sets the adhesive\nmaking it difficult to remove without leaving glue residue on the sheet. Traffic across sheets should be kept to a\nminimum, particularly with self-supporting products.\n15.4.13.3 \nProvision for Expansion - Tray Roofing \nNon-ferrous tray roofing expands at about twice the rate of ferrous metals. Supported angle seam and double\nseam profiles must be installed using a balance of sliding clips to allow for expansion, and fixed clips to\nwithstand gravity loads.\nThe position of the fixed clips depends on the roof pitch. The width of the fixed clip portion should be sufficient\nto install five clips at the required spacing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 15 \n 15.4 \n444\nThis is a controlled document.

It can be divided into three main\ncategories:\ninsulated panels,\ncomposite or site assembled systems, and\nroofs with insulation sprayed on after installation.\n15.5.1 \nInsulated Panels \nInsulated or sandwich panels are factory-made laminated products using different core materials permanently\nbonded by adhesive or foam to metal skins to act as a single structural element.\n15.5.1.1 \nInsulated Panel Manufacturing \nThe manufacturing process for bonded panels consists of roll forming the flat or profiled sheeting,\nfollowed by the adhesion of the insulation core to both surfaces or skins.\nThere are three methods to do this:\nContinuous production by injecting foaming insulation between 2 metal skins as they are being\nroll-formed.\nContinuous production by glueing pre-formed panels of insulation to roll-formed metal skins.\nIndividual panel production by glueing insulated panels to roll-formed sheets\nBonded composite panels develop their strength from the sandwich of skins and insulation, and are\nmade with a tongue and groove side lap detail that incorporates concealed fasteners.\n15.5.1.2 \nInsulated Panel Composition \nThe structure and composition of an insulated panel are chiefly determined by its end use.\n15.5.1.3 \nInsulated Panel Face Profiles \n Three types of profiles are used on insulated panels. This is largely determined by the spanning requirements and\nease of maintenance.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n447\nThis is a controlled document.

Panning can be minimised by using a matt finish or\nforming minor ribs or swages on the flat face of the panel.\n15.5.1.4 \nInsulated Panel Face Materials \nThe facings or skins of composite panels are typically metallic coated, pre-painted steel or\naluminium, and are either profiled or flat on either or both sides of the panel. The internal skin is\nalso known as the liner skin or sheeting.\nThe metal facing is commonly made from grade G300 steel of 0.40 - 0.63 BMT thickness, with a pre-\npainted organic finish over a metallic coating. Cool room panels have a galvanised Z275 metallic\ncoating, while interior/exterior structural insulated panels have an aluminium/zinc coating of\nAZ150 or AZ200. Paint coatings are specifically developed to assist in bonding the insulation to the\npanel\nAluminium facings are used in very humid conditions or severe marine environments and can be\nsupplied plain or pre-painted.\n15.5.1.5 \nInsulated Panel Core Materials \n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n448\nThis is a controlled document.

The most common are EPS (Expanded Polystyrene), PPS (Phenolic/Polystyrene), PIR\n(Polyisocyanurate), and mineral fibre.\nEPS\nEPS foam is mainly used for applications where high fire resistance is not a requirement.\nPPS\nPPS may be used where greater fire resistance is required.\nPIR\nPIR foam is increasingly specified because of its fire-resistant properties and better insulation\nefficiency.\nMineral Fibre\nMineral-fibre insulation may be selected for applications where fire resistance and/or acoustic\ninsulation properties are of prime importance.\n15.5.1.6 \nInsulation Panel Insulation Values \nThe insulation thickness of a profiled roof panel varies from 30 mm to 300 mm. To achieve the same insulating\nvalue as a flat panel, a profiled roof panel needs to be thicker. The through fasteners or fixing clips are thermal\nbridges, but it has been shown that these are unlikely to decrease the R-value by more than 2%.\nDifferent cores will also have different values for thermal insulation and noise attenuation, as will the details of\npanel joints and interfaces with other materials.\nThe manufacturer must calculate and state the net insulation value of a panel.\n R-values are the reciprocal of U-values. We will stick with R-value because that is the most commonly used value\nfor roofs and walls.\n15.5.1.7 \nInsulation Panel Structure \nInsulated panels are integral units in which the insulation layer together with the two metal skins act as a beam to\nresist wind and point loads. The bonded insulation core material contributes to the panel's strength by effectively\nincreasing the web depth of the profile and resisting buckling; the depth of the core largely determines the panel's\nresistance to deflection. Panel stiffness is also affected by skin thickness and profile shape.\nInsulated panels are excellent at supporting normal foot traffic without damage because the foam core provides\ncontinuous support to the external sheeting. The number and strength of the fasteners under wind suction loads\ncan limit the maximum purlin spacing.\n15.5.1.8 \nNatural Lighting for Insulated Panels \n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n449\nThis is a controlled document.

Polycarbonate or G.R.P. barrel vault roof lighting may be\nused for greater spans or proprietary systems may be supplied by the manufacturer.\n15.5.1.9 \nInsulated Panel Acoustics \nInsulated panels do not have inherently good acoustic insulation properties. Sound can be lessened by using\nsealed joints, but where higher levels of acoustic attenuation or absorption are required, it may be necessary to\ninstall additional acoustic lining systems.\n15.5.1.10 \nInsulated Panels and Internal Moisture \nMetal facings are effectively impervious to penetration by vapour, and panel cores have a closed\ncell structure which does not permit significant transmission or absorption of vapour. However, to\nprevent the possibility of interstitial condensation, it is necessary to fasten and seal all laps and\ngaps, side-lap joints, transverse laps, and joints and ridges that are exposed to the internal\nenvironment.\nWhen insulated panels are used as cold store insulation, a complete and continuous vapour barrier\nis essential to prevent inward moisture vapour pressure. Any discontinuity will result in a build-up\nof ice which can destroy the panel.\nThe bottom skins of composite panels have an integral side lap with a re-entrant sealing space\nwhich acts as a vapour control, but in high-risk applications such as food processing buildings,\ntextile mills, and indoor swimming pools an additional sealer strip is required in the side lap joint.\n15.5.1.11 \nInsulated Panels Fitness for Purpose \nThermal bowing can occur when the two skins are at significantly different temperatures such as north-facing\nwalls, e.g., when a cool room roof panel is in direct sunshine. The effect is accentuated when the external surface\nis a dark colour and is more severe for aluminium facings.\n15.5.1.12 \nInsulated Panel Installation \nThe use of insulated panels for roof and wall cladding requires the same or similar detailing for Structure,\nDurability, External Moisture, and other design considerations as those for single-skin roof and wall cladding.\n15.5.1.13 \nInsulated Panel Installation Safety \nIn most applications insulated panels can be installed by workers operating off the already installed sheet,\nnegating the need for safely mesh. Many panels are installed using underslung safety nets. Other than that, all\nsafety precautions should be followed as for any other cladding material.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n450\nThis is a controlled document.

Insulated\npanels are supported on purlins or girts, which should be accurately erected to a maximum tolerance of 3 mm and\na deflection limit of l/600.\n15.5.1.15 \nInsulated Panel Penetrations \nInsulated panels can accommodate penetration openings of 350 mm diameter or 300 mm square without the\nneed for additional structural supports or trimmers. Where larger holes are required, trimmers should be in place\nbefore the erection of the panels.\n15.5.1.16 \nFixing Insulated Panels \nPurpose-designed high thread-type fasteners are required to spread upwards loads and maintain the weather seal\nbetween the metal skin and the washer. Through fixings for roof panels may be rib fixed or located on a mini-rib\nwithin the trough, and should be set snugly to achieve a weatherproof seal without distorting the rib profile. Care\nmust be taken not to over-drive the fasteners as this can cause damage to the G300 outer skin of the panel which\ncan result in water ingress issues\nInsulated roof panels with trapezoidal ribs are through-fixed with a load spreading washer on the rib and require\nlap fixing and sealing at the side laps to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n15.5.1.17 \nInsulated Panel End Laps \nThe maximum practical length of panels for transport and handling efficiency is restricted to approximately 25 m.\nWhere a transverse joint is required, there are two options:\nButt End Lap\nWaterfall Junction\nButt End Lap\nThe lining and insulation are butt-jointed over the purlin, and a 150 mm overlap of the top sheet is formed in the\nexternal weather skin only, using three or more lines of sealant and fasteners. The sealant should be butyl tape,\nsilicone or MS sealant, or self-adhesive closed cell tape according to the specifications of the manufacturer and\nshould be positioned at the top and bottom of the lap. To provide a secure seal with flat or wide pan profiles,\nadditional sealed rivets or stitching screws are required through the top skins only.\nThe challenge with this detail is that there are four layers of material to consider at the side/end junction. While\nsuccessful in many instances, problems developing later are very difficult to remedy.\nWaterfall Junction\nA waterfall step can be achieved by putting a step in the rafter or by increasing purlin cleat heights,\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n451\nThis is a controlled document.

The second challenge is that any gap between the upper and\nlower sheets must be adequately insulated to ensure that the thermal efficiency of the system is not\ncompromised.\n15.5.1.18 \nInsulated Panel Flashings \nFlashings detailing is similar to that used with single-skin roof and wall cladding. The main exception is that\ninternal joints should be designed and sealed so that water vapour cannot impregnate the system.\nThe panels at the ridge and other edges of the roof should be sealed and the lining closed with a metal trim\nmounted on the ridge purlins as detailed by the manufacturer. Any gap between the ends of the composite panels\nshould be insulated to eliminate cold spots or cold bridging. They can be sealed using in-situ injected foam or\nmineral fibre. In high-humidity applications, the liner trim should be sealed to the panels. At end-laps or gaps,\nfoam should be injected to provide a vapour-tight seal.\nWhere required by the manufacturer, eaves panels should have the ends turned down to prevent capillary action\non the underside of the sheet. A metal flashing may also be installed to cover the exposed end of the insulation\nand metal liner when panel ends are visually exposed.\n15.5.1.18A Insulated Panels Ridge Detail\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel ridge flashing\nProfiled filler \nsealed top \nand bottom\n25 mm\nEmbossed\nwasher\nRidge \nnotched \ninto profile\n0.55 mm Coated \nsteel closure \nflashing\nPurlin\n5 mm\nGap\nRoof panel\nTurn up panel end\nFill Gaps with\nfoam filler\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n452\nThis is a controlled document.

They are not a true warm\nroof, as the ribs are typically not in contact with the insulation, but they have many of the same attributes as\nwarm roofs.\nThe mechanics of a composite system's performance are complex. Consideration must be given at the design\nstage to ensure the system is suitable for a particular end use. This would include consideration of various\naspects, including practicality of installation, durability of components, thermal performance, and control of\ninternal and interstitial moisture.\nThe advantages of composite systems are that they offer longer runs without the need for roof laps or waterfall\njunctions, and when the time comes for the replacement of the outer weather-proofing roof sheet, the system\nallows for it to be done without disturbance to the operations within the building.\nAcoustic boards can be laid within the system to increase sound absorption either from within the building or\nfrom outside. Installation of the under-liner sheets can make a building largely watertight, allowing other trades to\ncontinue below while the roof is completed.\n15.5.2.1 \nComposite Systems Composistion \nThere are three main types.\nBespoke systems that incorporate layers of material and insulation above the purlin.\nProprietary systems that are built up by layer above the purlin, such systems can be sandwich-type or post and\nrail.\nOverlay systems that are used for re-roofs over existing roofing.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n455\nThis is a controlled document.

They may be designed as closed systems, or ventilation may be\nintroduced between the insulation and the top surface. The insulation material may be expanded foam, mineral\nwool, or fibreglass blanket. Top surfaces may be profiled metal or membrane.\nPost and rail systems allow thicker insulation to be used, increasing thermal and fire performance.\n15.5.2.2 \nComposite System Installation \nComposite systems are normally laid layer by layer to form the desired system. Typically, they comprise a metal\nbase layer to provide support for the insulation, which is overlaid by a vapour check layer, insulation, underlay, and\nthe top roofing sheet.\nPost and rail systems are often used for overlaying existing roofs in good, safe condition. Another form of\noverlay uses custom-cut blocks as pan infills, over which is laid a continuous insulating layer. These forms of\nroof repair avoid the need for removal and replacement of an existing roof, allowing the building tenants'\noperations to continue uninterrupted.\nWhen installing composite systems, it is important that the vapour control layer is correctly installed and sealed\nto the manufacturer's requirements, and insulation is laid correctly without gaps. Bulk insulation must be able to\nloft up to its design thickness to achieve the design R-value.\nThese systems have a heavy reliance on accurate installation for them to meet their design expectations.\n15.5.2.2A Typical Composite Roof Unvented\nTop Deck\nSynthetic underlay\nPIR board\nLiner deck\nVapour layer\nAcoustic \nboard\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n456\nThis is a controlled document.

It can also be applied to walls, ceilings, and under floors. Spray foam may be applied to any roofing\nprofile. It has a greater insulation value per millimetre than other insulation materials, so is particularly suitable\nfor flat roofs and skillion roofs where there is limited air space.\nSpray foam is non-absorbent (less than 1%) and has strong contact with all adjacent building elements. This\nmakes it an effective vapour check, so internal moisture issues must be considered when using this or any other\nnon-permeable system.\n15.5.3.1 \nVentilation of Spray-on Systems \nWhen sprayed foam is applied directly to the underside of profiled metal sheet roofing on a lined building, the\nceiling space must be adequately ventilated by other means. (See 10 Internal Moisture.)\nInstallation with underlay.\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n458\nThis is a controlled document.

Check the building to confirm that the wrap is not loose or floppy, is properly attached to the studs, and\nis not sagging between purlins.\n2. Spray a \"flash-coat\" of Polyurethane Spray Foam over the building wrap or cladding contacting the timber\nor metal framing. Allow to set - it will take 5-10 minutes depending on the ambient conditions. The \"Flash-\ncoat\" will tension the building wrap, give it some rigidity, and assist with the curing and adhesion of\nsubsequent layers.\n3. Spray the first pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam onto the flash-coat. Do not exceed 25-30 mm with this\npass. This will render the building wrap/foam composite rigid and able to take the balance of the foam\nwith no distortion.\n4. Spray the second pass of Polyurethane Spray Foam to the desired thickness to achieve the required R-\nvalue (or up to a maximum of 100mm per pass).\n15.5.3.1A Spray-on Foam with Underlay\nRoof cladding\nUnderlay\nTop chord \nor rafter\nSpray-on \nfoam\n15.5.3.1B Spray-on Foam without Underlay\nDPC\nover\npurlin\nRoof \ncladding\nTop chord or rafter\nSpray-on foam\n 15 OTHER PRODUCTS\n 15 \n 5 \n 15 \n 15.5 \n459\nThis is a controlled document.

It has a greater insulation value per millimetre than other insulation materials, so is particularly suitable\nfor flat roofs and skillion roofs where there is limited air space.\nSpray foam is non-absorbent (less than 1%) and has strong contact with all adjacent building elements. This\nmakes it an effective vapour check, so internal moisture issues must be considered when using this or any other\nnon-permeable system.\n15.5.3.1 \nVentilation of Spray-on Systems \nWhen sprayed foam is applied directly to the underside of profiled metal sheet roofing on a lined building, the\nceiling space must be adequately ventilated by other means.
