This testing is used to demonstrate compliance with NZBC B1 - Structure\nCompliance with NZBC B2 - Durability is demonstrated by testing of profiled metal and fasteners. This testing is\nbased on AS/NZS2728 and AS/NZS 3566 respectively, again with some modifications.\nAlso included, are the MRM soft edge standard, and testing and performance standard for pre-painted coil.\n 17 \n 17 \n473\nThis is a controlled document.

Structural Testing covers uniformly distributed load (UDL) and concentrated (point load).\nThese procedures apply to all metals and plastic sheeting.\nThe UDL test simulates wind uplift by subjecting test specimens to pressure from underneath.\nUDL testing is typically carried out to simulate outward loads, where material is restrained by fasteners (or clips)\nat intermittent points; rather than inward loads where material is retrained linearly by purlins or girts. Even with\nasymmetrical trapezoidal profiles, failure adjacent to the fastener from the imposition of outward loads is\ninevitably cause of failure in typical applications. \nTesting for inward load can also be conducted, if required.\n17.1.1 \nStandards: AS Standards and COP Testing Standard \nThere is no specific New Zealand Standard for testing sheet roof and wall cladding. The MRM standard is broadly\nbased on the Australian Standards AS 1562.1:2018 and the AS 4040 series. These Standards are inter-related; AS\n1562.1 sets out the performance requirements to be achieved using the test methodology of AS 4040.\nThe MRM standard differs from the above standards in some significant aspects.\n17.1.1.1 \nUDL Load Testing Standard \nAS 1562.1 defines serviceability failure as a level of deflection under load.\nIn the COP standard, deflection testing is normative for wall cladding and informative for roof cladding. \nAdditionally, the COP standard defines serviceability failure of pierce fastened roofing as permanent deformation,\nwhen permanent distortion or splitting occurs around the fastener head. The load at which permanent distortion\noccurs around the fastener head is defined as serviceability failure and the roof can still resist greater loads, but\nthe damage would affect weather tightness.\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n474\nThis is a controlled document.

This is to\nassess the profile strength when laypeople or careless roof traffic fail to adhere to manufacturers'\nrecommendations.\n17.1.2 \nTest Requirements \n17.1.2A Uniformly distributed Load (UDL)\n1. Serviceability tests:\na. Deflection under load.\nb. Permanent deformation or cracking around the fastener head, or de-indexing or de-clipping of clip fastened\nprofiles. Serviceability failure of clip-fastened products may occur when a clip disengages from the central\nrib, but the weathertightness of the lap is not affected, and the roof can continue to resist increased loads.\n2. Strength tests.\nStrength tests are defined as: sheet unable to resist further loads, i.e. pull-off from clips, buckling, tearing or\npull-through of fasteners.\n17.1.2B Point Load\n1. Resistance to point load on the pan, or to two ribs of narrow profiles, at the weakest point.\n2. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\n3. Resistance to point load on a single rib at the weakest point.\n4. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\nLoad is applied in a downward direction through a rubber-faced pad. The weakest point is generally mid-span at\nthe rib/pan adjacent to the underlap.\n17.1.2.1 \nSupporting Structure and Equipment \n17.1.2.1A Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)\nThe design of the support system for wind load should consist of a rigid frame airbox, sealed on the bottom and\nfour sides. A fan or blower is required, capable of controlling and maintaining the required test pressure, and\npressure measuring devices. The deflection can be measured using several differential displacement transducers\nand traced and recorded coincidentally with the increasing load. Purlin and end wall positions can be changed to\ntest for multiple spans of different dimensions.\nThe use of airbags rather than air pressure is not endorsed by the MRM COP\n17.1.2.1B Point Load\nFor point load testing, a means of applying and measuring a continuously increasing load is positioned above the\npart of the material being tested. \n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n476\nThis is a controlled document.

Three is\npreferred as it results in a higher confidence factor. At least three different spans must be tested, and four is\npreferred as it gives a more accurate gradient to load-span graphs. For confirmatory testing to review previous\ntest results, smaller sample sizes are acceptable providing results are consistent with previous tests.\n17.1.2.2.2 \nWidth of Specimen \nThe width of a model or the test section of a lapped or interlocking system must be the width represented by at\nleast two sheet side laps. The total width of the testing rig (2.1 m) must be covered by the test sample or other\nmaterial.\n17.1.2.2.3 \nNumber of Spans \nFor testing continuous spans, the test specimen should incorporate no fewer than five spans; i.e., two end and\nthree intermediate spans. End spans should be two-thirds of the span of internal spans. Tests using four spans\n(two end spans and two internal spans) or three equal spans may be validated by comparing results against a\nfive-span test of the same sample and adjusting the resultant load tables accordingly.\n17.1.3 \nTesting Procedure \nDifferent testing regimens should be used for UDL testing or Point Load Testing.\n17.1.3.1 \nUDL Testing \nThe samples are assembled on the testbed in accordance with how they are intended to be used, with the ends\nand sides sealed to minimise loss of air pressure. Measuring devices for deflection are placed at static points\n(fasteners) and pan centre at mid-span or as required to measure maximum deflection.\nThe air pressure is raised incrementally, and the point of deflection failure noted. With pierce-fastened products,\nsigns of imminent deformation are observed. When product nears deformation failure, pressure may be\nperiodically backed off to allow loosening of a fastener to inspect the integrity of cladding profile underneath. The\npressure at these points should be noted. The maximum serviceability load test result is the recorded pressure\nlevel at the last observation before the onset of failure or the point before which the pressure level recorder\nshowed a sudden small drop signifying profile movement.\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n477\nThis is a controlled document. This copy of the Code Of Practice was issued 1 December 2025, and the next issue is due 1 March 2026.\nThe Online version of this document is the most up-to-date and in the case of conict the Online version prevails over any saved or printed version.\nMore than one serviceability result may be recorded from separate fasteners during a single test if, at the\ndiscretion of the testing engineer, the loads imposed on subsequent failure points are equivalent to those\nimposed on the initial failure point\nIf lap screws are added for the purpose of attaining failure pressures by decreasing air leakage, these must not be\npositioned closer than 0.5 m to the nearest purlin.\nClip fastened sections that de-clip at the central rib or de-index on a lap but still resist increased pressure,\nrepresents a serviceability failure.\nLoad is then increased to establish the strength load result. This may be when pierce-fastened cladding pulls\nfasteners through the profile or clip fastened profile de-clips. Both these actions result in sudden and permanent\nloss of air pressure and terminate the test. The load at which this occurs, or maximum load achievable due to air\nleakage, is recorded.\nIf strength load limits cannot be attained by the testing apparatus, a load of at least 2.0 times the serviceability\nload must be imposed to demonstrate that the sample failure load is governed by serviceability rather than by\nstrength. If serviceability/strength ratios exceed 2.0 for at least two different spans, it may be assumed that the\nratio will be similar on all spans.\nFastener pull-out from testbed purlins is not recorded as a failure as this is independent of the profile strength\nand is relevant only to the condition of the purlin material on the testbed. Such fasteners may be replaced or\nrepositioned and the test recommenced.\n17.1.3.2 \nPoint Load Testing \nConcentrated load must be applied in a direction perpendicular to the roof through a circular steel disc of 100 mm\ndiameter faced with a 20 mm thick rubber pad, with a Shore A Durometer hardness of 30-70, to the part of the\nprofile judged to be least resistant to load. See 3.6.1A Point Load Test at the MRM.\nWhere the dimension of the sheeting profile does not allow the use of a 100 (2) mm diameter pad, the shape\nmust be spread over two ribs by way of a disc and pad of 100 mm width.\nThe pressure cell and deflection sensor are positioned above the profile pan or rib at mid-span. For Type A\n(unrestricted access) and B roofs (restricted access), the load is increased to 1.32 kN, the pressure is released,\nand residual deflection is measured after 1 minute. Residual deflection must be less than S/1000 or 1.5 mm,\nwhichever is higher. The pressure is then increased to failure (or at least 2.41 kN) and noted. For Type C (non-\ntrafficable) and wall cladding, the initial pressure requirement is 0.60 kN and the secondary load is 1.1kN.\n 17 \n 17.1 METAL CLADDING TESTING\n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n478\nThis is a controlled document.

Before they can be offered as a design guide they must be\nchecked and interpreted by an engineer and have suitable factors applied to the test result figures. It is highly\ndesirable that this person has witnessed at least some of the tests being conducted. As fastener pull-out is not\nincluded in testing, published load-span tables should encourage the designer to check for pull out values of\nspecified fasteners when fastening into timber or ply less than 30 mm thick, into composite materials, or into\nsteel sections less than 1.2 mm thick.\n17.1.5.1 \nAllowance for Variation \n17.1.5.1A Factors to Allow for Variability of Structural Units\nNo of units tested\nCoefficient of Variation (COV)\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n1\n1.2\n1.46\n1.79\n2.21\n2\n1.17\n1.38\n1.64\n1.96\n3\n1.15\n1.33\n1.65\n1.83\n1.15\n1.3\n1.5\n1.74\n5\n1.13\n1.28\n1.46\n1.67\n10\n1.1\n1.21\n1.34\n1.49\n20\n1.06\n1.13\n1.21\n1.29\n100\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\nCoefficient of Variation (COV) is derived from Standard Dev / Av for a group of tests.

For strength loads, a coefficient of 10% may be assumed unless there is evidence that a higher figure\nis warranted. For clip-fastened products, the applied depreciation factor may not be less than 1.3.\nThe number of units tested relates to the number of valid results derived from a given fastener configuration and\npurlin spacing.\nFor values between those listed in the table, interpolation may be used.\n17.1.5.2 \nInterpreting UDL Load Results \nWhen using data from testing for producing graphs, tables, or other design aids, the following conditions apply:\na.\nData must not be extrapolated except where a minimum of four span-combinations within the limitations\nof (b) below can be shown to provide a statistically reliable load span graph. In such cases, an\nextrapolation of a further 10% at either end may be calculated.\nb.\nInterpolation of data between different spans of a specific type of test is acceptable only in the following\ncircumstances:\n<i>\nWhere the data is taken from tests for a single type, size, and profile of cladding and type and\nspacing of fastener.\n<ii>\nWhere at least three different spans or support spacings have been tested for the same type, size,\nand profile of cladding and fastener details, and that in all three tests the failure mode was the\nsame.\n<iii> Where test loads were derived from the same test criteria.\nc.\nThe client may decide whether to publish deflection results. When published they may elect to:\n<i>\nPublish delfection under load as a measurement \n<ii>\nPublish deflection as pass/fail where pass is less than or equal to (span/120) + P/30, where P is the\nmaximum lateral distance between cladding fasteners.\n<iii> Both of the above.\n17.1.5.3 \nInterpreting Point Load Results \nPoint load requirement for trafficable roofs is defined in NZS 1170 as 1.1 kN, which approximates a 100 kg\nperson on one foot. (Note: many workers carrying tools or equipment exceed this limit.) To allow for statistical\nvariation this is factored by 20% and a test load of 1.32 kN is applied to give a pass/fail.\nType A roof (unrestricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load on the rib without\ndeformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType B roof (restricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load in the pan or over two ribs\nwithout deformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType C Roof (non-trafficable) is required to withstand a 0.6 kN test load to the pan or over two ribs, and a 1.1 kN\nstrength load.

This is to\nassess the profile strength when laypeople or careless roof traffic fail to adhere to manufacturers'\nrecommendations.\n17.1.2 \nTest Requirements \n17.1.2A Uniformly distributed Load (UDL)\n1. Serviceability tests:\na. Deflection under load.\nb. Permanent deformation or cracking around the fastener head, or de-indexing or de-clipping of clip fastened\nprofiles. Serviceability failure of clip-fastened products may occur when a clip disengages from the central\nrib, but the weathertightness of the lap is not affected, and the roof can continue to resist increased loads.\n2. Strength tests.\nStrength tests are defined as: sheet unable to resist further loads, i.e. pull-off from clips, buckling, tearing or\npull-through of fasteners.\n17.1.2B Point Load\n1. Resistance to point load on the pan, or to two ribs of narrow profiles, at the weakest point.\n2. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\n3. Resistance to point load on a single rib at the weakest point.\n4. Residual deflection after imposition of serviceability load and application of strength load\nLoad is applied in a downward direction through a rubber-faced pad. The weakest point is generally mid-span at\nthe rib/pan adjacent to the underlap.\n17.1.2.1 \nSupporting Structure and Equipment \n17.1.2.1A Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)\nThe design of the support system for wind load should consist of a rigid frame airbox, sealed on the bottom and\nfour sides. A fan or blower is required, capable of controlling and maintaining the required test pressure, and\npressure measuring devices. The deflection can be measured using several differential displacement transducers\nand traced and recorded coincidentally with the increasing load. Purlin and end wall positions can be changed to\ntest for multiple spans of different dimensions.\nThe use of airbags rather than air pressure is not endorsed by the MRM COP\n17.1.2.1B Point Load\nFor point load testing, a means of applying and measuring a continuously increasing load is positioned above the\npart of the material being tested. \n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n476\nThis is a controlled document.

Three is\npreferred as it results in a higher confidence factor. At least three different spans must be tested, and four is\npreferred as it gives a more accurate gradient to load-span graphs. For confirmatory testing to review previous\ntest results, smaller sample sizes are acceptable providing results are consistent with previous tests.\n17.1.2.2.2 \nWidth of Specimen \nThe width of a model or the test section of a lapped or interlocking system must be the width represented by at\nleast two sheet side laps. The total width of the testing rig (2.1 m) must be covered by the test sample or other\nmaterial.\n17.1.2.2.3 \nNumber of Spans \nFor testing continuous spans, the test specimen should incorporate no fewer than five spans; i.e., two end and\nthree intermediate spans. End spans should be two-thirds of the span of internal spans. Tests using four spans\n(two end spans and two internal spans) or three equal spans may be validated by comparing results against a\nfive-span test of the same sample and adjusting the resultant load tables accordingly.\n17.1.3 \nTesting Procedure \nDifferent testing regimens should be used for UDL testing or Point Load Testing.\n17.1.3.1 \nUDL Testing \nThe samples are assembled on the testbed in accordance with how they are intended to be used, with the ends\nand sides sealed to minimise loss of air pressure. Measuring devices for deflection are placed at static points\n(fasteners) and pan centre at mid-span or as required to measure maximum deflection.\nThe air pressure is raised incrementally, and the point of deflection failure noted. With pierce-fastened products,\nsigns of imminent deformation are observed. When product nears deformation failure, pressure may be\nperiodically backed off to allow loosening of a fastener to inspect the integrity of cladding profile underneath. The\npressure at these points should be noted. The maximum serviceability load test result is the recorded pressure\nlevel at the last observation before the onset of failure or the point before which the pressure level recorder\nshowed a sudden small drop signifying profile movement.\n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n477\nThis is a controlled document.

This may be when pierce-fastened cladding pulls\nfasteners through the profile or clip fastened profile de-clips. Both these actions result in sudden and permanent\nloss of air pressure and terminate the test. The load at which this occurs, or maximum load achievable due to air\nleakage, is recorded.\nIf strength load limits cannot be attained by the testing apparatus, a load of at least 2.0 times the serviceability\nload must be imposed to demonstrate that the sample failure load is governed by serviceability rather than by\nstrength. If serviceability/strength ratios exceed 2.0 for at least two different spans, it may be assumed that the\nratio will be similar on all spans.\nFastener pull-out from testbed purlins is not recorded as a failure as this is independent of the profile strength\nand is relevant only to the condition of the purlin material on the testbed. Such fasteners may be replaced or\nrepositioned and the test recommenced.\n17.1.3.2 \nPoint Load Testing \nConcentrated load must be applied in a direction perpendicular to the roof through a circular steel disc of 100 mm\ndiameter faced with a 20 mm thick rubber pad, with a Shore A Durometer hardness of 30-70, to the part of the\nprofile judged to be least resistant to load. See 3.6.1A Point Load Test at the MRM.\nWhere the dimension of the sheeting profile does not allow the use of a 100 (2) mm diameter pad, the shape\nmust be spread over two ribs by way of a disc and pad of 100 mm width.\nThe pressure cell and deflection sensor are positioned above the profile pan or rib at mid-span. For Type A\n(unrestricted access) and B roofs (restricted access), the load is increased to 1.32 kN, the pressure is released,\nand residual deflection is measured after 1 minute. Residual deflection must be less than S/1000 or 1.5 mm,\nwhichever is higher. The pressure is then increased to failure (or at least 2.41 kN) and noted. For Type C (non-\ntrafficable) and wall cladding, the initial pressure requirement is 0.60 kN and the secondary load is 1.1kN.\n 17 TESTING AND MRM STANDARDS\n 17 \n 1 \n 17 \n 17.1 \n478\nThis is a controlled document.

Before they can be offered as a design guide they must be\nchecked and interpreted by an engineer and have suitable factors applied to the test result figures. It is highly\ndesirable that this person has witnessed at least some of the tests being conducted. As fastener pull-out is not\nincluded in testing, published load-span tables should encourage the designer to check for pull out values of\nspecified fasteners when fastening into timber or ply less than 30 mm thick, into composite materials, or into\nsteel sections less than 1.2 mm thick.\n17.1.5.1 \nAllowance for Variation \n17.1.5.1A Factors to Allow for Variability of Structural Units\nNo of units tested\nCoefficient of Variation (COV)\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n1\n1.2\n1.46\n1.79\n2.21\n2\n1.17\n1.38\n1.64\n1.96\n3\n1.15\n1.33\n1.65\n1.83\n1.15\n1.3\n1.5\n1.74\n5\n1.13\n1.28\n1.46\n1.67\n10\n1.1\n1.21\n1.34\n1.49\n20\n1.06\n1.13\n1.21\n1.29\n100\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\nCoefficient of Variation (COV) is derived from Standard Dev / Av for a group of tests.

For strength loads, a coefficient of 10% may be assumed unless there is evidence that a higher figure\nis warranted. For clip-fastened products, the applied depreciation factor may not be less than 1.3.\nThe number of units tested relates to the number of valid results derived from a given fastener configuration and\npurlin spacing.\nFor values between those listed in the table, interpolation may be used.\n17.1.5.2 \nInterpreting UDL Load Results \nWhen using data from testing for producing graphs, tables, or other design aids, the following conditions apply:\na.\nData must not be extrapolated except where a minimum of four span-combinations within the limitations\nof (b) below can be shown to provide a statistically reliable load span graph. In such cases, an\nextrapolation of a further 10% at either end may be calculated.\nb.\nInterpolation of data between different spans of a specific type of test is acceptable only in the following\ncircumstances:\n<i>\nWhere the data is taken from tests for a single type, size, and profile of cladding and type and\nspacing of fastener.\n<ii>\nWhere at least three different spans or support spacings have been tested for the same type, size,\nand profile of cladding and fastener details, and that in all three tests the failure mode was the\nsame.\n<iii> Where test loads were derived from the same test criteria.\nc.\nThe client may decide whether to publish deflection results. When published they may elect to:\n<i>\nPublish delfection under load as a measurement \n<ii>\nPublish deflection as pass/fail where pass is less than or equal to (span/120) + P/30, where P is the\nmaximum lateral distance between cladding fasteners.\n<iii> Both of the above.\n17.1.5.3 \nInterpreting Point Load Results \nPoint load requirement for trafficable roofs is defined in NZS 1170 as 1.1 kN, which approximates a 100 kg\nperson on one foot. (Note: many workers carrying tools or equipment exceed this limit.) To allow for statistical\nvariation this is factored by 20% and a test load of 1.32 kN is applied to give a pass/fail.\nType A roof (unrestricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load on the rib without\ndeformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType B roof (restricted access roofs) is required to withstand a 1.32 kN test load in the pan or over two ribs\nwithout deformation or excessive deflection, (serviceability load) and a 2.41 kN strength load.\nType C Roof (non-trafficable) is required to withstand a 0.6 kN test load to the pan or over two ribs, and a 1.1 kN\nstrength load.
