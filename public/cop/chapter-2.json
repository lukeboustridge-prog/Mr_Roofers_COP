R-values rate one single material while U-values\nmeasure entire components. For example, R-values\nmeasure how much heat loss passes through\nfibreglass insulation while U-values rate how\nmuch heat can pass through a window component\n(glass, air, vinyl sash). Typical insulation might\nhave an R-value of 19 while a window might have\na U-value of 0.35.\nR = 1/U. So a U value of 0.35 would equal an R-value\nof 2.86.
