The Code of Practice deals with External Moisture in\nfour sections, allowing for more detailed discussion. The solutions in the COP relate to all buildings and are not\nlimited to buildings within the scope of NZS 3604.\nIncluded in the COP under External Moisture:\nObjectives, Functional Requirements, Performance Requirements, and Limits of the NZBC Clause E2. The second\nhalf highlights the scope and extent of Acceptable Solution E2/AS1.\n7 External Moisture Roofing discusses the external moisture requirements and strategies for dealing with\nexternal moisture where it concerns metal roof and wall cladding.\n8 External Moisture Flashings suggests strategies of managing external moisture with a specific focus on\nflashings.\n9 External Moisture Penetrations focus specifically on managing external moisture and preventing leaks\naround penetrations.\nNZBC Clause E2 External Moisture (Extract)\n6.1.1\nE2 Objective\nThe objective of this provision is to safeguard people from illness or injury which could result\nfrom external moisture entering the building.\n6.1.2\nE2 Functional Requirement\nBuildings should be constructed to provide adequate resistance to penetration by, and the\naccumulation of, moisture from the outside.\n6.1.3\nE2 Performance Requirements\n1. Roofs shall shed precipitated moisture and snow.\n2. Roofs and external walls shall prevent the penetration of water that will cause dampness or\ndamage to the building elements.\nOther performance requirements quoted relate to transmission of ground moisture, areas below\nsuspended floors, condensation in concealed cavities, and construction moisture.\n\n 6.1 NZBC CLAUSE E2 EXTERNAL MOISTURE (EXTRACT)\nCompliance\nIn the context of COP Roof drainage, NZBC E1 requires that water discharging into a gutter must have less than\na 2% probability of entering a building. This means that those drainage paths inside the building envelope,\nincluding valleys and internal gutters, must be designed to accommodate a 50-year rainfall intensity over a short\nperiod. Roof Drainage Design discusses how the COP addresses this in more detail.\nThe above caveat equally applies to the limitations on run length of roof cladding, drainage capacity around\npenetrations, and discharge of spreaders, which are dealt with in:\n7 External Moisture Roofing,\n8 External Moisture Flashings, and\n9 External Moisture Penetrations.\nGutter catchments outside the envelope, which can discharge freely without entering the building, can be\ncalculated using less rigorous safety factors\nRelated Topics\nNZBC E2 - External Moisture is primarily focussed on a building's external envelope being able to resist weather\ninfiltration.\nAcceptable Solution E2/AS1 also has some information on gutter sizing and durability, but these are also covered\nin E1 - Surface Water and B2 - Durability.\nE2/AS1 also has some prescriptive solutions for structure regarding roofing spans which are omitted from B1 -\nStructure.\nFor clarity, this Code of Practice deals with the following topics discretely:\nResistance to loads in 3 Structure.\nDurability covered in 4 Durability\nGutter design covered in 5 Roof Drainage .\nNZBC E2 Compliance requirements in 6 External Moisture Overview.\nManaging water ingress of metal roof and wall cladding in 7 External Moisture Roofing.\nManaging water ingress through flashings in 8 External Moisture Flashings.\nManaging weathertightness of penetrations in 9 External Moisture Penetrations.\nManaging Internal Moisture is covered in 10 Internal Moisture.","pdfPages":[203,204,205,206],"subsections":[{"number":"6.1","title":"NZBC Clause E2 External Moisture (Extract)","level":2,"content":"6.1.1\nE2 Objective\nThe objective of this provision is to safeguard people from illness or injury which could result\nfrom external moisture entering the building.\n6.1.2\nE2 Functional Requirement\nBuildings should be constructed to provide adequate resistance to penetration by, and the\naccumulation of, moisture from the outside.\n6.1.3\nE2 Performance Requirements\n1.
