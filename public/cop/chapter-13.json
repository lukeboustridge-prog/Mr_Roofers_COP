      "content": "This section highlights some aspects of the New Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (HSWA 2015), including:\nresponsibility,\nworking at height in New Zealand, and\nworking on roofs.\nHSWA 2015: Objective\nThe objective of The Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 is protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of\nworkers, and other people.\nInformation used in this section was retrieved from\nhttp://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2015/0070/55.0/DLM5976660.html and\nworksafe.org.nz.\nHSWA 2015: Objective \n13.1 HSWA 2015: Objective\nThe objective of The Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 is protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of\nworkers, and other people.\n 13 \n 13.1 HSWA 2015: OBJECTIVE\nResponsibilities \nThe HSWA identifies four duty holders responsible for health and safety on site.\nThey are;\nPCBU's\nOfficers,\nWorkers, and\nOther People.\n13.2.1 \nPCBU \nThe person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) is not necessarily one person. It is a business entity in\nmost cases, but there could be more than one PCBU involved with a project; clients, principal contractors, and\nsub-contractors can all be PCBUs.\nThe 'Primary duty of care' of the PCBU is to ensure the health and safety of workers and anyone else who might\nbe affected by the work done.\n13.2.1.1 \nPCBU Responsibilities \nThe PCBU must (as far as reasonably practicable):\nProvide and maintain a workplace that is without risks to health and safety.\nEnsure the safe use, handling, and storage of plant, structures, and substances.\nProvide adequate facilities for the welfare of workers.\nProvide the information, training, instruction, or supervision that is necessary to protect all persons from risks\nto their health and safety arising from work.\nMonitor the health of workers and the conditions at the workplace to prevent injury or illness.\n13.2.2 \nOfficers \nOfficers are people (including chief executive officers and directors) who have significant influence over the\nmanagement of a business. An advisor is not considered an officer.\nSole traders have the responsibilities of both a PCBU and an officer.\n13.2.2.1 \nOfficer Responsibilities \nAn officer must take reasonable steps to:\nKeep up to date about work health and safety matters.\nUnderstand the nature of the hazards and risks associated with the organisation's operations.\nEnsure the organisation has resources and processes in place to eliminate or minimise risks.\nEnsure appropriate and timely processes are in place for receiving and responding to incidents, hazards, and\n\nrisks.\nEnsure there are processes for complying with any duty.\nVerify that health and safety processes are in place and being used.\n13.2.3 \nWorkers \nA worker is anybody who carries out work on behalf of a PCBU.\n13.2.3.1 \nWorkers' Responsibilities \nWorkers must:\nTake reasonable care to ensure the health and safety of themselves and others in the workplace.\nComply with health and safety policies and procedures of the PCBU.\nWorkers have the right to refuse to undertake unsafe or dangerous work.\n13.2.4 \nOther People \nOther people in the workplace includes visitors and customers.\n13.2.4.1 \nOther People's Responsibilities \nOther People must:\nTake reasonable care for their own health and safety.\nEnsure that their acts or omissions do not adversely affect the health and safety of others.\nComply with safety instructions and procedures issued by the PCBU.\nWorking on Roofs \nFalling from height is the most obvious hazard associated with installing roof and wall cladding. There is a\nhierarchy of techniques and mechanisms for ensuring safety at height.\n13.3A Working on Roofs Safety Systems\nSafety nets and high level,\nsoft landing systems.\nISOLATES the height\nhazard\nEliminate\nEliminate the height hazard by avoiding work at height if you can. If\nyou don't need to go up there, don't! For example, by assembly at\nground level.\nWork Equipment\nGroup Control Measures\nPersonal Control Measures\nEdge protection systems,\nbarriers, scaffolding,\nguardrails, Multi-user MEWP,\nsafety mesh\nMINIMISES height and\nthe consequences of\nthe height hazard\nSafety nets at low level (<6 \nm) Remote soft landing\nsystems.\nTotal restraint system, single\nuser MEWP, platform (podium) \nladder, mobile guarding system,\nman cages\nLifejackers, inflating air suits\nMINIMISES through\nmanagement controls\nTrestles, hop-up trestles,\nplatforms\nLadders, stepladders, stilts\nDESIRABLE\nUNDESIRABLE\nMINIMISES the\nconsequence of the\nheight hazard\nWork positioning systems,\nindustrial rope access, fall arrest\nsystems.\nSource: MBIE Best Practice Guidelines for Working on Roofs: 2012\n13.3.1 \nSafe Access to Roofs \nSecure temporary access must be provided when there is no permanent access to roof areas. Preferred means of\ntemporary access include scaffolding, constructed work platforms, or mobile elevating platforms.\n13.3.2 \nAssessment of Existing Roof Cladding \nRoofing material deteriorates over time. Before beginning any work on a roof, inspect the roof surfaces to\ndetermine its condition and identify weak spots (e.g., abnormal corrosion).\n13.3.3 \nWeather Conditions \n\nWeather conditions may affect working conditions adversely.\nAdverse weather conditions include:\nmoisture (dew, condensation, rain, or snow),\nhigh wind, and\nsun glare and UV radiation.\nWorking At Height \nSource: Worksafe: Working at Height in New Zealand.\nMany falls from heights are caused by a lack of planning. Dangerous situations can be improved by identifying,\nassessing, and managing hazardous situations.\n13.4.1 \nScaffolding \nScaffolds are a common way to provide a safe work platform.\nScaffolds must comply with the Scaffolding, Access & Rigging New Zealand (SARNZ) Best Practice Guidelines\nfor Scaffolding in New Zealand or equivalent guidelines or a higher standard.\nScaffolds should be erected, altered and dismantled only by persons who have been trained and have suitable\nexperience with the type of scaffolding in use.\n13.4.2 \nRoof Edge Protection \nEdge protection is used to prevent persons, objects, or materials from falling.\nEdge protection may be:\na proprietary (engineered) system,\nmaterials to form a guardrail or physical barriers,\nerected scaffolding that supports a temporary edge protection system, or\na combination of solutions.\nSee https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/working-at-height/working-at-height-in-nz/\n13.4.3 \nSafety Mesh \nSafety mesh protects workers against falling through a roof while they are installing cladding; it should be used in\ncombination with appropriate edge protection. For more information about using Safety Mesh,\nsee https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/working-at-height/working-at-height-in-nz/. \nSafety mesh should comply with AS/NZS 4389 Safety Mesh.\n13.4.4 \nSafety Netting \nSafety netting describes fall arrest systems using temporary netting. This must be designed and installed in\ncompliance with Worksafe: Best Practice Guidelines, Safe use of Safety Nets.\n\nMechanical Access Plant \nMechanical Access Plant includes:\nmobile elevated work platforms,\nforklift platforms,\ncrane lift platforms, and\nknuckle booms\n13.4.6 \nSafety Harness \nSafety harnesses may be of Total Restraint type or fall arrest type.\nTotal Restraint types are preferable, they protect a person from approaching an unprotected edge\nFall arrest or Positioning systems limit the distance a person can fall\nAll safety harness systems must be adequately anchored, and in fall arrest systems rescue planning must be\ndeveloped prior to use.\n13.4.7 \nSoft Landing Systems \nThese mitigate the effect of falls by providing an energy absorbing landing area. They are generally applied where\npotential fall height is low.",
